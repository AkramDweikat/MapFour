The \"lame duck\" period ahead of an election typifies this theme. Yet US President Barack Obama, for so long shackled by a pragmatic belief in compromise within the structures of US power, may be at his most radical now that the midterms have delivered a Republican-controlled Senate.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Obama\'s bold position on immigration is dominating the US political bandwidth with Republicans furious at his \"unilateral abuse\" of presidential power. No longer having to triangulate policy through one of the most negative Republican Congresses in modern history may be a catalyst for a dynamic and unpredictable period of US politics ahead. In foreign policy terms, the Middle East continues to dominate the inbox of outstanding issues and Syria watchers could be in line for an important recalibration of what the US role in the region looks like. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">To embark on this new direction, the last thing Obama needed was obstacles from within and <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/11/chuck-hagel-departure-politics-a-20141129663540747.html\" target=\"_blank\">chucking Chuck Hagel should come as no great surprise</a> following the defence secretary\'s <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2014/11/us-defence-secretary-stepping-down-20141124141638580711.html\" target=\"_blank\">infamous Syria memo</a> criticising the administration back in October.

We should not forget the recent IRC research that described the conflict as the \"<a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2014/08/29/238157_syrias-violence-prompts-worse.html?rh=1\" target=\"_blank\">worst humanitarian crisis to strike the Middle East</a> in at least a century\". While Obama has a plan for his <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/09/isil-crisis-everyone-winner-20149196353157875.html\" target=\"_blank\">ISIL strategy</a>, it has prioritised keeping the coalition together over answering harder questions on what to do for a longer term Syria strategy. It is one thing to kill hundreds of ISIL fighters but can Obama construct a strategy that saves millions of Syrians? </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Indeed with now half of the country displaced from their homes, you could argue that the US is at risk of formulating a Syria strategy too late to save a Syria that has already ceased to be.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Politics is about both priorities and a sense of what is possible. For too long the debate on Syria has been simplified into the future of one man. An emboldened Obama has to look beyond Assad to the millions of Syrians who have lost homes, loved ones and any sense of future as we approach the fourth anniversary of the crisis. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The humanitarian response is often seen only as a reaction to the symptoms of the conflict rather than the core of it but if the people are placed front and centre a host of consequences are possible.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Let me outline some of the tools of this \"Syrians first policy\" surge that Obama could explore; firstly recognising the scale of the crisis requires leadership on its longer term ramifications. Obama should respond to louder demands for the larger scale repatriation of refugees to US. The Syrian crisis cannot be contained in either Syria or the immediate region and helping the most vulnerable with a chance to rebuild some sense of life in countries that can offer stability and security is a humanitarian prerogative.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"></span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Humanitarian response</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Secondly, as winter approaches the underfunding of the appeals that put food in the mouths and blankets on the shoulders of Syrian refugees must be met. While the US has certainly played its role, it needs to put <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.oxfamnovib.nl/Redactie/Downloads/Rapporten/bp190-fairer-deal-syrians-090914-embargo-en21.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">more pressure on others</a> to make sure they have done too. Bringing wider responsibility and resources to the humanitarian response can then allow the US to credibly push for the regional states to ensure that their <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/13/david-miliband-west-syrian-refugees\" target=\"_blank\">borders remain open</a>.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Thirdly, the US could put serious thought into Turkish-led discussions as to safe havens or protected zones in the north of Syria. Obama\'s ISIL policy in Syria has failed to address what will backfill the degrading of the extremist group in these parts of the country as the \"moderate Syria Opposition\" is far from being able to carry that burden at this time and may not be for years. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The KRG in Iraq remains a testament to how a policy can avoid existential questions of regime change but still answer the humanitarian prerogative, but only genuine leadership for the world\'s most powerful countries can chart the course to a similar entity emerging from the apocalyptic rubble of Syria.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Obama unleashed could develop a policy towards Syrians rather than Syria - which is increasingly a zombie state, missing half of its population from their homes and searching for a future not defined by death and despair. </span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">James Denselow is a writer on Middle East politics and security issues and a research associate at the Foreign Policy Centre. </span></i></STRONG></em></p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/images/2014/11/30//201411305530709734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/images/2014/11/30/201411305530709734_20.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-30 18:14:50','James Denselow',34.80207500,38.99681500,NULL,NULL),(3,'2014113064935204169','http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2014/11/moldova-begins-voting-crucial-election-2014113064935204169.html','Moldova begins voting in crucial election','Sunday\'s vote could decide whether former Soviet nation moves towards the EU or turns back to Russia.','<p>Moldovans have begun voting in a crucial parliamentary election between parties that want to move closer to Europe and those that want to move back into Russia\'s orbit.</p>\r\n<p>Sunday’s election takes on wider significance with the unrest in neighbouring Ukraine.</p>\r\n<p>Moldova, like Ukraine, <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/peopleandpower/2014/07/moldova-under-influence-20147178139162372.html\" target=\"_blank\"> has a pro-Russia separatist region in its east </a> .</p>\r\n<p>The former Soviet republic of less than four million people is <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/04/moldova-stuck-between-russia-eu-2014426115456162891.html\" target=\"_blank\"> will have to decide </a> between re-electing the current pro-European coalition or choosing parties that want closer economic ties with Moscow.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>\"If the pro-European parties win, Moldova\'s course towards European integration could become irreversible,\" Arcadie Barbarosie, executive director of the Institute for Public Policy in Chisinau, told the AFP news agency.</p>\r\n<p>\"If Moldova turns back towards the customs union [with Russia], however, it risks remaining forever in Russia\'s sphere of influence.\"</p>\r\n<p>Moldovans will vote for MPs to serve a four-year term in the 101-seat parliament.

Guards are given the same authority as police and work in close cooperation with them, he added.</p>\r\n<p>Private security personnel reportedly perform routine training exercises through the streets of Wadi Hilweh during the night, often using live ammunition.

Some of them have been on a <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"https://vpn.aljazeera.net.qa/International/wireStory/,DanaInfo=abcnews.go.com+syrian-hunger-strike-greek-parliament-27138647\" target=\"_blank\">hunger strike since Monday</a> and several have been hospitalised. They demand nothing more and nothing less than the equivalent of \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\", as Thomas Jefferson wrote in the US declaration of independence. But to actually put this into practice, they must defy laws currently in place in the European Union, of which Greece is a member. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">The refugees, who have even set up a dedicated Facebook page, want to leave Greece with adequate travel documents. They want to pursue happiness in other European nations, where they believe conditions will be better for them compared to the crisis-hit country where they are currently stuck, having escaped war and <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"https://vpn.aljazeera.net.qa/feature-stories/,DanaInfo=frontex.europa.eu+people-smugglers-the-latter-day-slave-merchants-UArKn1\" target=\"_blank\">ruthless traffickers</a>. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">\"We demand the Greek government to find a solution for Syrians in Greece,\" reads a sign in English, at the small protest camp which the refugees take care to keep tidy. Packs of food are set out but left untouched. One night, a homeless Greek woman couldn\'t help herself from taking a tangerine from an open bag and was pleasantly surprised when no one reacted.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><STRONG><i>Bound by Dublin System</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Unfortunately, and despite the refugees\' best behaviour, Greek authorities cannot legally grant the protesters the right to travel freely to other European countries and look for work or apply for asylum there. Greece is bound by the so-called Dublin System (including all EU member countries apart from Croatia, along with Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland), whereby refugees making their way to Europe must apply for asylum and then remain in the European country they first reach. Greece and Italy bear the brunt of this burden.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Interestingly, Syrians enjoy a privileged status, compared to other refugees - if qualifying for war refugee status can be called a privilege. Provided they have a Syrian passport or identification card, even expired, they can apply for and receive political asylum on the same day. No other alien nationals have this right. If a refugee has a relative already benefiting from asylum in another Dublin System country, they can apply to be reunited with them. This would take two to three months. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">If a Syrian refugee does not have any documents, they again can apply for asylum in Greece, but the process would take longer. Applying for asylum would mean the protesters would have access to aid for food, housing and public healthcare, as a government minister who met them on the square last week tried to explain. As for the right to work, unfortunately they would be in the same precarious situation as most Greeks, who face soaring unemployment.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Indeed, Greece has seen its economy lose a quarter of its output in the last six years. Last Tuesday, if the protesters had looked to the other side of Syntagma Square, they would have seen the offices of Greece\'s finance ministry still lit, deep into the night, as officials were preparing for tough negotiations with international creditors. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Even so, it is interesting to see other groups of Greek protesters offering support. For example, among the first to help, bringing food, clothes and blankets, were the almost 600 public sector cleaning ladies who were <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"https://vpn.aljazeera.net.qa/international-solidarity/,DanaInfo=595katharistries.wordpress.com+\" target=\"_blank\">fired because of the austerity measures</a> and who have staged another sit-in not far from the square. The Syrian protesters are aware of all this and that is why they are refusing to apply for asylum. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><STRONG><i>What about Palestinians and Iraqis?</i></STRONG> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Syrians, of course, are not the only foreigners suffering. Palestinians, who for years were living as refugees in Syria, have seen their lives once again torn inside out. And never mind those seeking to escape the permanent pain of the West Bank and Gaza. This recently was put in the spotlight by the story of a young Palestinian girl who left Syria for Europe with her parents. Her parents drowned at sea when traffickers rammed their boat. Approximately <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"https://vpn.aljazeera.net.qa/news/world/europe/story/,DanaInfo=www.straitstimes.com+going-crazy-survivors-tell-europes-deadliest-migrant-shipwreck-20140918\" target=\"_blank\">500 souls were lost</a>. Masa Dasouki survived, to face a different kind of ordeal, as she is now living in an Athens orphanage and for the moment cannot be reunited with her uncle, who got asylum in Sweden. The situation has grown worse for Iraqis, too. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Moreover, the situation for all migrants in Greece, simply is bad. A <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"https://vpn.aljazeera.net.qa/blogs/sarah-irving/,DanaInfo=electronicintifada.net+new-short-film-reflects-brutal-life-palestinian-refugees-greece\" target=\"_blank\">new documentary by acclaimed Palestinian</a> film-maker Mahdi Fleifel illustrates one aspect. The other aspect is the plight of those migrants held in detention camps. In the rest of Europe it is not ideal, either. Yet thousands keep coming. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">It would seem that the Syrian protesters are demanding the impossible. They do not have the law on their side. But laws can change. Europe should be doing something more than export arms. And countries like Greece and Italy should not become dumping grounds for the world\'s wretched. Even the <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"https://vpn.aljazeera.net.qa/content/pope-urges-european-leaders-to-do-more-for-migrants/,DanaInfo=www.voanews.com+2533519.html\" target=\"_blank\">pope recently urged European leaders</a> to do more for migrants.

Rumours swirled in local and regional media that Hirak, as the secessionists are often described, planned to declare independence outright, seize government buildings and attack \"northern\" military units stationed in the south. </p>\r\n<p>To quell the hysteria and dispel fears that an announcement of independence could lead to outbreaks of violence, the Hirak faction behind the camps had to arrange a press conference laying out their plans. </p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\"People are scared, and there are many lies around,\" Sheikh Hussein bin Shuaib, a southern secessionist cleric who describes himself as the \"president\" of the protest camps, told Al Jazeera. \"It will be peaceful.\"</p>\r\n<p>Without resorting to violence, Bin Shuaib says, Hirak will \"escalate\" its current campaign of civil disobedience from Sunday onwards, holding three demonstrations a week, calling for secessionists to strike and create an economic blockade in the port town, and closing the border with the north for several hours a day. They may also blockade oil production facilities in the south of the country, he said. </p>\r\n<p>The question for many is whether or not the November 30 declaration will be another missed opportunity for a movement that has hugely popular aims in the south of Yemen but has struggled to achieve internal cohesion. </p>\r\n<p>For seven years, southerners have been agitating for secession, holding regular marches and populating the south of the country with the flag of the former PDRY, despite harsh penalties under former president Ali Abdullah Saleh. Yet, they have produced few, if any, tangible results, with the movement wary of repeating the mistakes of the past by using violence to achieve their aims. A 1994 attempt at secession through force was brutally defeated by northern military and tribal forces. </p>\r\n<p>\"It was bloodshed and economic disaster and if we repeat this, after the war we would face big problems,\" said Saleh Abdulhaq, a former colonel in the PDRY military who was a senior southern military adviser during the civil war. \"If you lose 60 or 70 percent of your people and you win, you have really lost.\" Instead, he said, southerners must \"raise our voices\" and force the UN to act.</p>\r\n<p>When Saleh was unseated by a 2011 uprising that morphed into a battle between different factions of his regime, there was an opportunity for southerners to exploit the ensuing security vacuum and declare independence. Most of the movement\'s most prominent leaders refused to attend peace talks held in Sanaa in 2013 and early 2014 to make their case. Now, following the takeover of Sanaa in September and a subsequent period of rapid territorial expansion by a group known as the Houthis, calls for independence have become more urgent. The Al-Orod camp, established after an October 14 pro-secession rally that drew more than 100,000 people into Aden, is emblematic of this renewed focus. </p>\r\n<p>\"When the Houthis went into Sanaa, it changed things; it helped us a lot,\" Bin Shuaib said. \"The security presence in Aden and Hadramawt [an eastern province] is looser. The government is not here; it gives us a big space.\"</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"https://vpn.aljazeera.net.qa/news/middleeast/2014/10/,DanaInfo=www.aljazeera.com+yemen-southerners-see-hope-houthis-rise-2014102052535893759.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 16px;\">RELATED: Yemen\'s Southerners see hope in Houthis\' rise </span></a></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>There are other reasons that Hirak may be gaining confidence. The neighbouring Gulf states have long maintained a pro-unity stance when it comes to Yemen, but the Houthi takeover of Sanaa and the group\'s continued expansion may be changing their calculus, said a Sanaa-based power broker who meets regularly with members of Hirak and representatives of Gulf governments.</p>\r\n<p>The Houthis follow the Zaydi form of Shia Islam largely unique to northern Yemen, and stand accused by their Gulf neighbours of being backed by Iran. In November, the UAE designated the Houthis, who also go by the name Ansar Allah, as a terrorist group, following the lead of Saudi Arabia. \"They are looking at the south as a way of penalising the Houthis, and of protecting themselves against them,\" the source told Al Jazeera. </p>\r\n<p>Although he has not been formally told that the GCC states are likely to back the secessionists, Bin Shuaib believes the threat of Houthi control over the Bab al Mandeb strait - a vital maritime chokepoint that separates the Red Sea from the Indian Ocean, and is vital to trade for Saudi Arabia and Egypt - could lead to formal support for Hirak. Already, he said, Gulf businessmen were helping to underwrite the cost of the protest camps. Abdulrahman al-Jidri, a prominent Hirak supporter who is said to have close ties to the regime in Riyadh, returned to Aden from self-imposed exile in late November and brought donations totalling around SR1m, or $260,000, Bin Shaib said.</p>\r\n<p>Saleh bin Farid al-Awlaki, a prominent southern sheikh who also has close ties with the governments of Saudi Arabia and the UAE, agreed that the Gulf states could soon shift their position on southern independence. But they will only fully support the movement when they have a clear view of who its leaders are, he added. Despite repeated attempts since 2011, Hirak\'s most popular leaders have repeatedly failed to form a united front.</p>\r\n<p>\"The problem is, they say, how can we talk to so many leaders, parties, groups, in the south,\" al-Awlaki said. \"If you want to talk to us, you should be united. Form some kind of leadership council and we will take you seriously.\"</p>\r\n<p>The Gulf states also have concerns that some of the southern movement\'s most prominent leaders have ties to Iran. \"We in the south are Sunnis, there is no chance for us to be connected with Iran,\" al-Awlaki said. \"Our future is with the European countries and our neighbours.\"</p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/29/20141129144753326734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/Images/2014/11/29/20141129144753326734_20.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-30 02:12:51','Peter Salisbury',15.36944510,44.19100660,NULL,NULL),(29,'2014102612741435665','http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/10/iraq-economy-tatters-amid-isil-war-2014102612741435665.html','Iraq\'s economy in tatters amid ISIL war','Massive deterioration in country\'s security situation and ongoing instability in Baghdad have hit financial sector hard.','<p><STRONG><i> Baghdad - </i></STRONG>Iraq\'s financial sector is facing a recession because of the war between the country\'s security forces and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), whose fighters have seized one-third of Iraq\'s territory and displaced up to two million Iraqis.</p>\r\n<p>Experts say the massive deterioration in the country\'s overall security situation and ongoing instability in Baghdad have particularly impacted the country\'s financial sector. The sector is comprised of 55 banks, of which 32 are private-sector enterprises, 7 are government-owned and 16 are international players. An additional 49 separate investment and other financial firms round out the list.</p>\r\n<p>\"Iraq\'s financial sector was already structurally deformed,\" Salam Adel, a financial commentator, told Al Jazeera. \"It is set to face serious repercussions after the refusal of thousands of Iraqi citizens to make debt payments this summer.\"</p>\r\n<p>This spells imminent bankruptcy for several Iraqi banks, Adel said, noting loans taken out by displaced Iraqis have now been written off as bad debt. \"It is now Baghdad\'s responsibility to compensate the banks given that the present state of affairs is the product of its public policies.\"</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/baghdad-braces-more-isil-attacks-201411351253419391.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 16px;\">RELATED: Baghdad braces for more ISIL attacks</span></a></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Private-sector banks in Iraq are withholding consumer loans due to security concerns after approximately 600 million Iraqi dinars ($515,000) were stolen from both private and state banks in Nineveh, Salahuddin, and Anbar provinces.</p>\r\n<p>ISIL denied that its fighters had robbed banks within the provinces it controlled, insisting fighters had shuttered those banks\' doors and tapered their assets, bringing business to a halt.</p>\r\n<p>But some beg to differ. Bassem Jameel Antoine, an Iraqi financial expert, says public confidence in Iraq\'s banks remains intact, but the sector as a whole is suffering because this fiscal year\'s budget has not yet been ratified.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, the government in Baghdad has not deposited its funds in private Iraqi banks for seven years. \"The end result of Baghdad\'s public policies is that government-owned banks in Iraq are flush with cash, while their private-sector counterparts are strapped,\" Antoine told Al Jazeera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some analysts say it is only natural for the banking sector to suffer during wartime. \"Prior to the conflict, Iraq\'s banking sector was already limited, carrying out only rudimentary functions such as buying and selling currency from the Central Bank of Iraq,\" explained economics expert Ali al-Sayhood al-Sudani. \"The Iraqi central government should enact an expedited emergency action plan to save the country\'s economy.\"</p>\r\n<p>Such a plan could include an agreement by Iraqi authorities to pay the debts owed by displaced persons. With buildings and farms being destroyed on a massive scale, agricultural and real-estate loans have become an unbearable burden for debtors, Sudani said. He described Iraq\'s banking sector as the \"biggest loser\" in the government\'s confrontation with ISIL.</p>\r\n<p>The dire situation faced by the country\'s banks calls for an intervention on a scale familiar to Iraq observers.

Race issues took centre stage on America\'s televisions and in its newspapers.</p>\r\n<p>But many voices accused the mainstream media of giving too much prominence to the potential for violence and not enough to the decision itself. Young black Americans used #BlackTwitter to take journalists to task on their coverage and provide their own version of the truth.

Typography, the way letters are dressed, the way words are designed may seem secondary to the meaning of the words they house. But form affects content. And in the news media, it affects the authority and the credibility of the stories being told. Helvetica conveys more neutrality than Lucida. Arial more sobriety than comic sans.

Why push out a loyal secretary of defence in the heat of a conflict with ISIL, the withdrawal of US forces in Afghanistan, continued Russian provocations in Eastern Europe and Ukraine, and domestic political fights about our national security and the defence budget? </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The recent midterm election no doubt played a role in US President Barack Obama\'s thinking. While the shellacking that Obama and the Democratic Party took was not a direct result of his foreign policy, there is no doubt that Obama\'s perceived lack of a clear strategic approach to the problems in the Middle East and Ukraine played a part. Faced with a US public deeply wary of further US military engagement abroad, a soon-to-be actively hostile Republican-controlled Senate, and a complex set of interlocking crises in the Middle East, Obama felt that he needed to shake things up by removing a high-profile person from his national security team, regardless of whether that person bore any responsibility for the challenges facing Obama. </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Hagel was an obvious choice to take the fall. Although a member of the opposition Republican Party, Hagel does not have many supporters among Republican leaders because of his earlier sharp criticism of President George W Bush\'s conduct of the Iraq war. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">In fact, only four Republicans in the Senate voted to confirm Hagel as secretary of defence in 2013, after a bruising confirmation hearing that weakened Hagel\'s standing out of the gate. Perhaps most critically, Hagel never bonded with Obama\'s closely knit national security team.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Creating problems</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">But in trying to solve one problem, Obama has created several others. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">First, he has to find a suitable secretary of defence to replace Hagel. Hagel has done everything the president wanted him to do as secretary of defence. He has kept a lid on the Pentagon\'s budget, carried out Obama\'s pivot to Asia strategy, ended the combat mission in Afghanistan, began fixing the broken nuclear weapons complex and reforming the Pentagon\'s management, and dealt forcefully with the scourge of sexual violence in the military. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Will Obama be able to find someone as loyal and competent as Hagel for the next secretary of defence? Will Obama be able to find someone willing to go through a grueling confirmation process to serve for less than two years, with limited opportunity to leave their own imprint on US national security strategy?</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Second, administration officials have justified Hagel\'s departure by saying Obama needed \"fresh leadership\" and \"a different set of skills\" in the Pentagon. But without shaking up either the national security staff in the White House or the centralised and risk-averse way the Obama administration makes national security policy, there is little chance of a new secretary having a big impact. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">For example, when weighing the planned drawdown of US forces in Afghanistan and the military\'s request to keep 10,500 troops in the country after December 2014, the National Security Council held 20 meetings, including two with the president and six involving the secretary of defence. After all these meetings, the number was pared to 9,800.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Facts on the ground</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Finally, Obama has increased the pressure on himself to shake up not only his personnel, but his strategy. However, Hagel\'s departure does not change the facts on the ground, and a new Secretary of Defence is unlikely to prompt radical changes in Obama\'s foreign policy. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">In the Middle East, Obama may accelerate the arming and training of the Syrian opposition or deploy a handful of US ground forces in Iraq to coordinate close air support of Iraqi forces and better targeting of air strikes against ISIL, but he will not commit US troops in significant numbers or begin bombing Assad directly. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Managing the current anti-ISIL coalition will continue to be a delicate art, and improving Iraq\'s security will be a slow process, dependent on actions of the Iraqi government. In Europe, Obama will continue to work closely with NATO to deter further Russian aggression, including a rotational presence of rapid response forces in the Baltics, and push to maintain and increase sanctions on President Vladimir Putin\'s inner circle. Obama is unlikely to provide lethal arms to the Ukrainian government or open the door to Ukrainian NATO membership. In Afghanistan, the US withdrawal of troops will continue as planned. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Obama\'s foreign policy modus operandi to date has been one of slow and careful steps, rather than going all-in on big bets. Don\'t expect this to change with a new secretary of defence. Hagel\'s abrupt departure is for political, rather than strategic reasons. </span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Lawrence J Korb is a Senior Fellow at American Progress and former Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower, Reserve Affairs, Installations, and Logistics.</span></i></STRONG></em></p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/images/2014/11/29//2014112961032575734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/images/2014/11/29/2014112961032575734_20.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-29 18:28:10','Lawrence J Korb',38.90719230,-77.03687070,NULL,NULL),(52,'2014112383710141702','http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/11/what-comes-after-ebola-hunger-2014112383710141702.html','What comes after Ebola: Hunger','West Africa is on the brink of a major food crisis as a result of the Ebola outbreak.

However, the Ebola crisis has curbed the progress these countries have made and threatens to undo its positive effects.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Restrictions on people\'s movement and quarantine zones to contain the spread of the Ebola led to panic and subsequent food shortages and price hikes. Farmers were severely affected by this crisis, as many abandoned their farms and harvests fearing contracting the disease. This in turn resulted in major disruptions in food production.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"></span></div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">In Sierra Leone up to <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://washington.cbslocal.com/2014/10/16/agriculture-minister-40-percent-of-sierra-leone-farmers-have-abandoned-their-farms/\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"internallink\">40 percent</span></a></span><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://washington.cbslocal.com/2014/10/16/agriculture-minister-40-percent-of-sierra-leone-farmers-have-abandoned-their-farms/\" target=\"_blank\"> of local farms were abandoned</a> in the worst affected areas. In some cases, communities are already facing food shortages due to poor road accessibility, while others have threatened to disobey quarantine orders in order to search for food supplies.</span> </span></p>\r\n<p><span>In Senegal and other countries in West Africa, food shortages have worsened after regional trade was disrupted</span><span> due to border closures and quarantine measures. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Border crossing closures and the reduction of trade through seaports have curbed food supplies in the whole region. Most West African states are net cereal importers; trade and transportation disruptions have dramatically increased the price of such imports.    </span></p>\r\n<p><span><STRONG><i>Cash crops under threat</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span>In addition to subsistence farming, cash crops are also under threat. While disruption of cash crop (cocoa, palm oil, rubber, etc) agriculture is not directly tied to food insecurity, it still harms communities that rely on these crops for their livelihoods. Without the money from a cocoa harvest, for example, many rural farmers in West African countries, like the Ivory Coast, would not be able to afford buying food.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>The Food and Agriculture Organisation at the UN (FAO) has already stressed the dire effects of reducing the purchasing power of tens of thousands of already vulnerable households in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. \"[This] means less food on their plates and increased nutritional risks for families already on subsistence diets,\" Bukar Tijani, Regional Representative for the FAO in Africa, <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/253824/icode/\" target=\"_blank\">said in a statement</a>.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span></span></p>\r\n<p><span>Foreign direct investment is also seriously threatened by the Ebola crisis. This is exacerbating the already high unemployment rates and pushing the region even further towards a major food crisis. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>The World Bank study shows that no matter what happens in the coming months, Ebola will have a huge economic impact. According to the bank, the economic toll from the <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.euronews.com/2014/10/10/world-bank-estimates-ebola-cost-in-west-africa-at-326-billion-dollars/\" target=\"_blank\">Ebola epidemic could reach</a> <span class=\"internallink\">$32.6bn</span> by the end of 2015.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>It is important for the international community to take immediate action that will ensure not only the aversion of famine now, but also the creation of a sustainable system of food production for the future. Delivering food directly to the population by humanitarian agencies is not a sufficient response, and can even be harmful in many cases.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Furthermore, it would be a big mistake to push these countries towards agricultural policies that prioritise growth, quantity, and export-oriented cash crops over local production and traditional crops. Instead, a positive approach would encourage ecological agriculture that respects local people\'s food security and food sovereignty. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><STRONG><i>Sustainable response</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span>A sustainable response to the food crisis would include agricultural policies that enable states to become self-sufficient in food and allow farmers to exert significant control over government decision-making in the agricultural sphere. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Food security is essential and the lack of adequate food can quickly become a destabilising factor in countries that have suffered from conflict and insecurity for decades.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Disasters, natural or man-made, can sometimes be an opportunity for a fresh start. The post-Ebola recovery is a good time to rebuild the agricultural systems in these countries based on the principles of social justice, sustainability and environmental responsibility.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>The international community cannot delay its action on the looming food crisis. To wait and delay a rapid response may well lead to famine, insecurity and the return of conflict. The consequences of post-Ebola food insecurity could cause much more human suffering and chaos than the disease itself.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i>Hilal Elver is a Special Rapporteur on right to food.

Because, according to the verses, \"both women and men originated in a single Self (nafs), [they] have been endowed with the same natures, and make up two halves of a single pair.\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Another female Islamic scholar, Hidayet Tuksal has a similar interpretation. Commenting on Erdogan\'s remarks, the renowned Turkish women\'s rights activist </span><a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"https://vpn.aljazeera.net.qa/haber/,DanaInfo=t24.com.tr+erdoganin-fitrat-sozlerine-cevap-kuranda-kadin-ve-erkek-fitratini-tanimlayan-ayet-yok,278351\" target=\"_blank\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">said</span></a><span lang=\"EN-GB\">: \"Mr President might be inspired by his religious identity, but there is no verse in the Quran that clearly defines woman\'s and man\'s nature. Instead, there are verses that define human nature.\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In addressing gender in any religion, it is important to understand the impact of culture on theology and the ways in which such interaction has shaped social practices. That is why Muslim women\'s experiences vary immensely by location and personal circumstances such as family upbringing, class and education.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The distinction between culture and religions is often ignored by community and state leaders in many of the Muslim majority countries. </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">They often ground inequality in the idea that God gives some different responsibilities and rights to women. Predictably, thinkers like Bulac </span><a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"https://vpn.aljazeera.net.qa/columnist/ali-bulac/,DanaInfo=www.todayszaman.com+toward-a-feminist-autocracy_228576.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">dismiss</span></a><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> the effect of patriarchy: \"The argument that the male-dominated culture dates back to ancient times is a superstition invented by social scientists of the last century.\" </span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Because of such views, the endorsement of misogynist interpretations of Islam continues.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">But as Barlas points out, \"the Quran seeks to protect women\'s rights within patriarchies by recognizing their sexual specificity as women\", not the other way around. </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Motherhood in Islam</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Erdogan\'s remark on mothers also caused much outrage among women\'s rights activists: \"Our religion has defined a position for women: motherhood.\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">From the Islamic point of view, Erdogan is right: Motherhood is exalted in Islam. In the Quran, special attention is given to the suffering of the mother in pregnancy and labour and the duty of children to be thankful for her self-sacrifice: \"</span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">His mother carried him, [increasing her] in weakness upon weakness, and his weaning is in two years\" (Quran 31:14); \"His mother carried him with hardship and gave birth to him with hardship.\" (Quran 46:15). Moreover, the Quran privileges mothers in terms of parents\' rights and some Hadith mention divine rewards for nursing mothers.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Yet, it is wrong to think that Islam portrays </span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">motherhood as a woman\'s only function and worth. What about the women who cannot or choose not to have children? Are they unworthy in the eyes of God? Muslims should recall that one of the Prophet\'s wives, Aisha, was not a mother, but remained immensely important to both the Prophet and the community because of her high moral character and deeds.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">One of the most quoted Islamic dictums that relates motherhood to Islam is a Hadith of Prophet Muhammad: \"Heaven lies at the foot of your mother.\" Yet this Hadith has not been translated among Islamic thinkers into interest in the various experiences of motherhood and its transformative role in women\'s lives.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The key problem in the Muslim world regarding gender issues is that medieval religious texts produced in highly patriarchal environments and based on biological essentialism are still regarded highly in Islam.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Sanctifications of motherhood without mentioning its hardships for women - in their home or workspace - are not reflective at all of the Muslim woman\'s experience. Motherhood is not just simply a biological process that leads to birth; it involves many complex factors: In Turkey for example, those would be </span><a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"https://vpn.aljazeera.net.qa/nation/2014/11/26/,DanaInfo=www.dailysabah.com+activists-take-to-streets-to-protest-violence-against-women\" target=\"_blank\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">violence against women</span></a><span lang=\"EN-GB\">, </span><a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"https://vpn.aljazeera.net.qa/pulse/tr/originals/2014/01/,DanaInfo=www.al-monitor.com+turkey-marriage-child-brides-poverty-education-religion.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">child brides</span></a><span lang=\"EN-GB\">, </span><a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"https://vpn.aljazeera.net.qa/indepth/opinion/2014/08/,DanaInfo=www.aljazeera.com+informal-female-work-turkey-com-201481163535208284.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">women\'s informal work</span></a><span lang=\"EN-GB\">, widowhood, social security services, etc. </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Therefore, awareness on women\'s experiences must be continually extended, addressing new challenges and describing new experiences. Religious scholarship of motherhood, therefore, cannot stop at mere glorifications of selfless love and idealised portrayals of mothers.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>In this light, one key problem in Erdogan\'s speech, which is also very common among conservative Muslim men, was to assume that \"feminists\" are disregarding the biological differences between the genders and are disrespectful of religious traditions. However, the very fact that there are many self-declared \"Islamic feminists\" (such as Hidayet Tuksal) reflects the fact that feminism as a movement that advocates gender equality may share much in common with progressive readings of Islam in terms of respect for women\'s lives and rights.</p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In the end, the safety and wellbeing of mothers, as well as women who can\'t become mothers or choose not to should be the government\'s concern in any country around the world, regardless of religious or cultural views. The battle for gender equality is a global mission, which can be accomplished only by more thoughtful self-criticism, and not the holier-than-thou competition between cultures.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i>Riada Asimovic Akyol is pursuing her doctorate in International Relations at Galatasaray University in Istanbul.

Survivors who dare to speak out face harrassment and intimidation, as do the human rights defenders working with them to seek justice. This is the lived reality for women under Thein Sein\'s \"reformist\" government. Four years into Myanmar\'s transition, many things look different, but nothing has changed. There are some very clear reasons for this.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">It has been well established that </span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Myanmar\'s</span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> Constitution is notable for all the wrong reasons - it grants military personnel de facto impunity from prosecution, a veto over any parliamentary legislation, and allows the arbitrary imprisonment of human rights defenders and activists. It is less widely known that Myanmar\'s 2008 Constitution and legal framework formally guarantees gender inequality. The UN has noted that Myanmar is unique in this regard. The consequences of this gender inequality are all too real for women across Myanmar: state-sponsored gang-rape and rape, systematic denial of justice, and marginalisation in political and public life.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">While</span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> the de facto impunity afford</span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">ed</span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> to the military </span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">remains </span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">the largest</span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> obstacle to obtaining justice</span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">, it is </span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">underpinned by the complicity of state authorities - the judiciary, police, and political representatives - at the most local level</span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">. Because crimes involving the military are referred to the court-martial system - and are exempt from civilian oversight - there is no pressure on the military to make proceedings public. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Survivors and local-level authorities know that when a case is brought against a member of the military, the chances of obtaining justice are very slim. For women seeking justice through channels available at the local level, the intransigence of state authorities often dissuades them from attempting to hold perpetrators</span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> accountable</span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">.</span></span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">The absence of transparency and accountability has created a culture of fear for both survivors of state-sponsored sexual violence, and the human rights defenders who work with them for justice.

The military and government have done nothing to shatter this culture of silence in these recent years of reform.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Development projects</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Alongside this, the international community must recognise that</span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> human rights </span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">abuses in</span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> Myanmar\'s ethnic communities are closely linked to development projects. </span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Many of these projects are</span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> taking place in resource-rich areas where conflict between Ethnic Armed Organisations and the military is either ongoing, or resting on often-violated ceasefire agreements.

The aims of these documents are laudable - targeting the root causes of sexual violence in conflict, ending all forms of discrimination against women, and ensuring that women play a key role in shaping the future of Myanmar\'s public and political life. But, as with much else in Myanmar\'s transition, promises of substantive change have had very little impact on the ground.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">None of the Women\'s League of Burma\'s member organisations have seen any action from the government to make good on their promises, and the means though many women work to affect positive change, local civil society remains fraught with security risks. Whatever change might be taking place at the central level, it is not altering decades-long patterns of human rights abuses and denial of justice for women in Myanmar\'s ethnic communities. Today we must demand substantive change for the women of Myanmar, whose suffering at the hands of state-sponsored sexual violence has been ignored for too long. </span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Tin Tin Nyo is General Secretary of the Women’s League of Burma.</span></i></STRONG></em></p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/images/2014/11/26//20141126104245713734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/images/2014/11/26/20141126104245713734_20.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-29 03:08:55','Tin Tin Nyo',0.00000000,0.00000000,NULL,NULL),(73,'2014112814625150832','http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/israel-fm-supports-paying-arabs-leave-2014112814625150832.html','Israel FM supports paying Arabs to leave','Avigdor Lieberman says he favours providing economic incentives for Arab-Israelis to leave the country.','<p>Israel\'s foreign minister says he supports paying Arab citizens to leave the country.</p>\r\n<p>In a manifesto of his right-wing Yisrael Beitenu party, Avigdor Lieberman said he favoured ceding Arab majority areas in northern Israel to a future Palestinian state and providing economic incentives for Arab-Israelis - about 20 percent of Israel\'s population - to encourage them to emigrate.</p>\r\n<p>The manifesto, published on Friday, did not set out positions on the most difficult issues in the Israel-Palestinian conflict, including the status of Jerusalem and Israel\'s borders.</p>\r\n<p>But it does acknowledge the necessity of territorial compromise in reaching a peace deal with the Palestinians, and also with moderate Arab countries.</p>\r\n<p>Once a close associate of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Lieberman is now seen as harbouring prime ministerial ambitions himself.</p>\r\n<p>His offer to pay Israeli Arabs to leave comes as Netanyahu pushes forward with a contentious parliamentary bill to formalise Israel\'s status as a Jewish state - a measure that many Arab-Israelis say will institutionalise their status as second class citizens.</p>\r\n<p>The bill, which Netanyahu says is necessary to safeguard Israel\'s future, is opposed by a wide range of Israeli political figures, including the largely ceremonial president, but is strongly supported by right wing members of his ruling coalition, including Lieberman.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Israeli security forces fired tear gas at several dozen rock-throwing demonstrators at the Qalandiya checkpoint north of Jerusalem following weekly prayers Friday.</p>\r\n<p>There were no immediate reports of injuries or arrests.</p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2013/11/11//20131111193454271734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/Images/2013/11/11//20131111193454271734_20.jpg',NULL,'AP','2014-11-29 01:38:22','Al Jazeera',0.00000000,0.00000000,NULL,NULL),(74,'2014112885157300755','http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/11/disappointing-saarc-summit-2014112885157300755.html','A disappointing SAARC summit','Rivalry between India and Pakistan overshadows meeting of South Asian country leaders.','<p><span>The 18th summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) has concluded in Kathmandu, Nepal, with an outcome far below expectations.</span></p>\r\n<p>On top of the agenda were three connectivity agreements on road, rail and energy, to be endorsed by the eight SAARC leaders.

It also signalled its persisting resistance to India expanding its economic engagement with Afghanistan.

Treating us as a \"demographic threat\", Israel champions our citizenship in front of the world as alleged proof of its democratic nature, while simultaneously attempting to limit our presence and influence in society. </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Following the state\'s declaration of independence, the first Prime Minister David Ben Gurion, dismayed at the number of Palestinians who stayed in their ancestral lands, lamented that Israel <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/the-makings-of-history/will-we-ever-find-out-what-the-censor-left-out.premium-1.509647\" target=\"_blank\">wouldn\'t be able to</a> \"clear the entire central Galilee region\" of the then 100,000 remaining indigenous residents without a war. </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">But Israeli leaders have actually attempted to do so, even in peacetime. In recent years, a plan to demolish the Galilee village of Ramiyya and expel its people is one example of attempts to make Ben Gurion\'s dream come true. As Professor Hilel Cohen of the Hebrew University <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/resources/briefing-papers/806-palestinians-in-israels-democracy-the-judaization-of-the-galilee\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>, \"The project of \'Judaizing the Galilee\' commenced when the state [of Israel] was founded and has continued in various guises to the present day.\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">In the Negev region, Palestinian Bedouins with Israeli citizenship have been exposed to home demolitions and denied basic services, such as water, electricity and education. Living in more than 40 \"unrecognised\" villages across that region, an estimated 53,000 men, women and children face impending eviction. </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Al-Araqib, for instance, <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://english.pnn.ps/index.php/human-rights/8597-israel-razes-bedouin-village-in-negev-for-the-78th-time\" target=\"_blank\">has been razed</a> by Israeli bulldozers 78 times since July 2010. Its residents, however, refuse to leave, returning and rebuilding it each time. Was it not already clear to them that Israel\'s leaders viewed us as second-class citizens from day one? And can a Jewish \"nation-state\" bill, largely devoid of practical content, possibly make their daily lives any more difficult?</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><span>The opposition to the law by Israel\'s so-called \"centrists\" and \"liberals\", such as finance minister Yair Lapid and justice minister Tzipi Livni, exposes the whole affair as yet another case of Israel\'s political establishment debating over and controlling our future without our input.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">A failed project</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Nonetheless, Palestinian political parties in Israel continue to sit as lawmakers in the Knesset. Ostensibly convinced that they could impact the laws being pumped out of the parliament, they continue to vie for our votes and encourage us to support them each time campaign season comes around. </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">But this has proven to be a failed project. Despite giving the opportunity to speak in the Knesset, they have not made our daily reality any better.

The order, despites all its intentions, evoked a surprising and remorseless criticism from neighbour states in East Africa, especially Kenya and Uganda.  </p>\r\n<p>Even before the ink on the order had dried, a Kenyan economist at the Brookings Institute rushed to call the decision \"<a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/africa-in-focus/posts/2014/09/16-south-sudan-leadership-state-failure-kimenyi\" target=\"_blank\">stupid</a>\". As if that was not enough, on a nationwide show, Kenyan NTV called the Republic of South Sudan a \"<a class=\"internallink\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NTVKenya/photos/a.80240814057.71846.51790559057/10152074524309058/\" target=\"_blank\">thankless kid</a>\". I suppose that \"kid\" refers here to the short time span of South Sudan’s independence (declared in 2011).</p>\r\n<p>Ugandan prime minister, on the other hand, warned the government in Juba against pursuing this measure, asking that the decision be rescinded. He was soon after his statement <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-29274427\" target=\"_blank\">relieved</a> of his job. Whether this was unrelated to his remarks on South Sudan or not, it was a responsible move by President Yoweri Museveni to sack him.</p>\r\n<p>The South Sudanese government decided against proceeding with its plan soon after it was announced.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p>However, to date the negative sentiment about the order is still being felt. If you are a South Sudanese travelling to Nairobi, Kenyan immigration officers at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport would often greet you with questions such as: \"Why do you come again to Kenya when you (South Sudanese) are chasing away Kenyans in your country?\" I usually answer with great irritation that, \"I am not here to work!\"</p>\r\n<p>The persistent hostility over this matter begs the question: Was Kenya really under the illusion that the South Sudanese people were to transfer their sovereignty from Sudan to Kenya? Did anybody in East Africa really think South Sudan is a \"kid\" that would never grow up?</p>\r\n<p>The motivation behind this ministerial order was to create space for the South Sudanese to find jobs and be responsible citizens by paying their taxes. It called for positions of executive directors, secretaries, HR officers, receptionists, etc in public and private enterprises to be given to South Sudanese citizens.</p>\r\n<p>It did not call for the expulsion of foreigners of any nationality in South Sudan. It simply aimed to establish a procedure for regulation of the work force; any sovereign nation has the right to do so. Besides, a sensible mind would, indeed, agree that the decision by the minister was rightly placed when considering issues of national security.</p>\r\n<p>What I find strange was how a well-educated economist at Brookings Institute, Mwangi S Kimenyi, found a rather strange parallel between the South Sudanese case and Idi Amin’s order to expel foreigners from Uganda. If I have to remind Mr Kimenyi, both the republics of Kenya and Uganda have institutionalised similar workforce priority to their citizens. How many foreigners in these countries work as directors, secretaries, HR officers, receptionists, etc? Countries around the world regulate access to their labour markets to foreigners, either through laws or strict visa regimes. Why should South Sudan not follow suit?</p>\r\n<p>Right now, government officials are using Kenyans and Ugandans as secretaries when South Sudanese are sitting jobless by the roadside sipping tea all day long. This practice has been ongoing ever since the Republic of South Sudan established an open-border policy with its neighbours. If anything, this Republic has been more thankful than necessary and, in some cases, has allowed others to exploit it.</p>\r\n<p>The ministerial order in my view, and in the view of many South Sudanese, was not comprehensive enough.</p>\r\n<p>It was not right for an economist in a highly respected US think tank to provide such misguided interpretation and compare it to the policy of expulsion by the former President Idi Amin. NTV’s qualifier, \"thankless kid\" is purely insulting to South Sudan and completely disregarding reality.</p>\r\n<p>To the contrary, South Sudan has been overly generous with its neighbours and their citizens.</p>\r\n<p>Counting the years of independence, South Sudan is a kid, yes. But the kid must grow up!

He spent most of the last two years in Turkey, working illegally for $350 a month and saving up for his $1,000 seat on a rubber dinghy from the Turkish coast to the Greek island of Kos. He then made his way across Greece on boats and buses. Unwisely, he had spent most of his money - $4,000 - on a fake EU residence permit that Igoumenitsa authorities confiscated.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The mountains that surround Igoumenitsa are full of migrants in Khalifa\'s situation. By day, the forest floor is littered with plastic water bottles, carrier bags, snack wrappers and discarded clothing. By night, the forest comes to life with the voices of Syrians, Afghans, and Palestinians, choosing their moment to jump onto trucks as they queue up for security inspections.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The risk of stowaways is highest on busy nights, when the truck queue goes back for a kilometre into the darkness,</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> says a coastguard officer, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Some 100,000 articulated lorries annually traverse its sparkling white concrete from east to west.

Another had a hatch in the roof of the driver</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\'</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">s cabin. In yet another, several Afghan children had been stuffed into plastic olive barrels. One teenager was found suffocated inside a false fuel tank.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Stone seems to be a favourite camouflage material, perhaps because X-ray scanners cannot penetrate it. On one occasion, 16 migrants were found inside two hollowed-out granite slabs. On another, migrants were ensconced amid stacks of flagstones. Perhaps the most ingenious disguise consisted of marble sheets leaning against A-frames and dug out like books. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Fourteen Afghans were found inside them, and the coastguard estimates the value of this human cargo at more than $50,000.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The cost and elaborateness of these preparations, say officials, suggest deals made in Turkey between organised crime rings and trucking companies, rather than casual contracts with individual drivers along the way.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Usually such deals work. Amjad, a 23-year-old Syrian from Damascus, crossed to the Greek island of Lesvos in mid-October. Within a month he was in Germany, walking and driving through Albania, Montenegro, Serbia, Hungary and Austria.

And there is one important element that was left unexplored in our film which deserves mention: the science behind yoga and meditation.</p>\r\n<p>The last decade has seen an explosion of research into how and why yoga, mindful breathing and meditation impact our brains, bodies and behaviour. It\'s long been believed that yoga and meditation can positively affect a person\'s mood. But now, cold hard evidence appears to be confirming what sages and saints have been saying for thousands of years.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p> In 2012, 68-year-old Buddhist monk Matthieu Ricard was named the world\'s happiest man. Researchers at the University of Wisconsin wired up the Frenchman’s skull with 256 sensors. The scans showed something remarkable. Daily meditation has given Ricard an exceptionally large capacity for joy and reduced his propensity towards negative emotions. Researchers showed that regular yoga and meditation can lead to increased activity in the brain\'s left prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for memory, mood and emotions, among other things. And you needn\'t be a Buddhist monk to benefit. Research suggests that just three weeks of 10 to 20 minutes of daily meditation can positively alter your brain.</p>\r\n<p>Neuroscience is taking us deeper into the inner workings of our minds. And it\'s revealing fascinating truths about our innate ability to heal ourselves, alter our dispositions, and according to Dr. Deepak Chopra, even change the expression of our genes.</p>\r\n<p>Chopra is part of a movement that aims to provide evidence of consciousness - a term thrown around loosely in the world of yoga and meditation that basically means an intense form of self-awareness, starting with the body and eventually encompassing all of existence.</p>\r\n<p>Yoga and meditation are bringing the usually hostile worlds of religion and science together; showing us that each individual has the capacity to heal themselves, physically and emotionally, through self-awareness and reflection.\"</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://webapps.aljazeera.net/aje/custom/2014/portraitofayogi/fixed/index.html\"><STRONG><i></i></STRONG></a></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>From the Filmmaker:  </i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><em> By Marie-Helene Carleton </em></p>\r\n<p>While working on this film and talking to people about their yoga journeys, I became intrigued by tales of their first time on the mat - and where it led. Just as there are multifold ways of doing yoga, so there are many stories of how one comes to it.</p>\r\n<p>But I started to notice a trend. Men often came to yoga to heal a physical injury, while women sought to heal an emotional one.</p>\r\n<p>A male professional wrestling champion who hurt his back needed to save his career. A troubled young man who described his upbringing as racist and violent fell off a building while high on drugs, broke his back, and couldn\'t walk. A young boy with debilitating health problems was given a cornucopia of pharmaceuticals that made him sicker.</p>\r\n<p>A young female dancer struggled with an eating disorder resulting from a sexual assault. An actress battled a deeply negative self-image. A female journalist needed to find a way to cope with the trauma of 9/11 and the death of her friends.</p>\r\n<p>But while these gendered starting points may seem like a dichotomy – I started yoga to heal my back, or I started yoga to heal my heart – people often discover that the physical and mental benefits converge over time as the physical practice leads to an emotional awakening.</p>\r\n<p>Through the physical practice, the wrestler heals his back, and then creates his own form of yoga in order to bring it to men who regard it as only being for women. The troubled young man finds he can walk again, and evolves his perspective of others, becoming a peace-loving vegetarian, teaching a rigorous form of yoga and breathing techniques at Ted talks. The sick boy heals his body through yoga and becomes a world-class yoga athlete who champions the spiritual aspects of his practice.</p>\r\n<p>And the emotional, internal journey leads to physical wellbeing and integration with the body. The young dancer finds a way to cope with her trauma, and the loss of control, creating a new and popular form of yoga that is about ease and simplicity. The actress learns to love her body and becomes a popular yoga instructor and body model for yoga brands. The journalist finds acceptance of the past and peace in her life, with a rigorous two-hour yoga practice every day.</p>\r\n<p>The physical and emotional journeys intersect.</p>\r\n<p>In recent years, the starting point for yoga has shifted as well. Returning combat veterans are using yoga to heal the emotional and psychological wounds of post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>\r\n<p>The way people talk about yoga – as a spiritual technology, a science of the soul, or body prayer – are different narrative roads that lead to a similar point. What makes yoga distinctive is the mind-body connection led by the breath. Here, the mind and body are not in opposition, but unified through the act of breathing. Yoga is an experience of a special connection that happens when the physical and the mental come together and become something transcendent.</p>\r\n<p><em> Micah Garen, Co-Filmmaker contributed to this article.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yoga at The Shard, London, UK [Marie-Helene Carleton/Al Jazeera]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kajza Ekberg, Boxing yoga, London, UK [Marie-Helene Carleton/Al Jazeera]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diamond Dallas Page, DDP Yoga, Venice Beach, CA, USA [Marie-Helene Carleton/Al Jazeera]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Praise Moves, a Christian alternative to yoga, Barstow, CA, USA [Marie-Helene Carleton/Al Jazeera]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sri Dharma Mittra at the Dharma Yoga Center, New York City, US [Marie-Helene Carleton/Al Jazeera]</p>\r\n\r\n','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/20/20141120133532380580_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/Images/2014/11/20/20141120133532380580_20.jpg',NULL,NULL,'2014-11-27 21:08:22','Al Jazeera',51.50735090,-0.12775830,NULL,NULL),(105,'201411265532438379','http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/11/black-one-white-separate-unequa-201411265532438379.html','\'One black, one white, separate and unequal\'','Many African Americans live in segregated neighbourhoods, endure a racially biased criminal justice system.','<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\"Our nation is moving towards two societies, one black, one white - separate and unequal.\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">This dismal analysis came in 1968 from the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, better known as the Kerner Commission.

These barriers have roots in the past, but they endure in the present. </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Even in regions untouched by the legacies of slavery and Jim Crow laws, government policies largely relegated black people to segregated ghettoes while denying them access to homeownership. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">When the Federal Housing Administration started insuring private mortgages in the 1930s, it classified black districts as uninsurable risks. Restrictive covenants banned blacks from buying homes in certain white neighbourhoods. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">By the 1950s, federal funds made possible an expansive network of highways to suburbs, while public housing concentrated black poverty in the urban core. Such practises reflected the Kerner Commission\'s contention that \"white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto\".  <br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, was not the typical inner-city \"ghetto\". African Americans started moving there in the 1980s. But its key institutions testify to the enduring barriers of race. As blacks moved in, whites fled. As of 2010, Ferguson was 69 percent black and 29 percent white. Yet the mayor, police chief, five of six City Council members, and six of seven School Board members are white. An astonishing 50 of its 53 police officers are white. In St Louis County, 47 percent of black men aged 18-24 are unemployed. About three times as many blacks live in poverty as do whites.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Poor black districts</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The shooting of Michael Brown did not occur in a vacuum. Black residents of Ferguson complain about constant traffic stops and unfair arrests, a reflection of a justice system that is criminalising a generation of poor, young, African American men. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">In the past 30 years, since the introduction of Ronald Reagan\'s \"War on Drugs,\" the American prison population has surged from 300,000 to over 2 million, despite no corresponding increase in crime rates. Federal drug laws concentrate on poor black districts. In some cities, up to 80 percent of black males have a criminal record, creating a situation that scholar Michelle Alexander calls \"the new Jim Crow\".</span></p>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">None of this was inevitable. The Kerner Commission advocated for an ambitious slate of programmes to combat racial inequality: jobs programmes, urban investment, improvements in police training, and policies to end residential segregation.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Johnson ignored the report, and his political successors abandoned attention to the nation’s most pressing social problem. The issues of race and urban poverty are off the political table. Even now, in the wake of yet another shooting of an unarmed black boy by a white authority, US President Barack Obama just offers milquetoast pleas for law, order, and mutual understanding.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The violence in Ferguson may be desperate, futile, and self-destructive, but it is easy to understand, for anyone who cares to understand. Black people are angry about the shooting of Michael Brown, because they are angry about the hurdles that a black youth must jump to get a chance at the American Dream. Black people are angry about the Darren Wilson verdict, because they are angry about how powerful institutions are aligned against the disadvantaged. Black people are angry about America, because it is \"two societies, one black, one white - separate and unequal.\"</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: normal;\"><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Aram Goudsouzian is Chair of the Department of History at the University of Memphis and author of \"Down to the Crossroads: Civil Rights, Black Power, and the Meredith March Against Fear\".

Swat, with its lush green mountains, snow-capped peaks and numerous streams and rivers was long a tourist haven for Pakistanis, known locally as \"the Switzerland of Pakistan\".</p>\r\n<p>All of that changed, however, when Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan\'s local Swat chapter, then led by Mullah Fazlullah, a hardline local cleric, took control of the valley from 2007 to 2009: the valley became a no-go area for outsiders, as the TTP enforced its strict, authoritarian version of Islamic law on the populace.</p>\r\n<p>Many of Swat\'s orchards, too, were badly affected, local residents say. Swat supplies Pakistan with peaches, persimmons (known locally as \"Japanese fruit\"), apples, oranges and a range of other fruits. Under the Taliban, however, local agriculturalists told Al Jazeera that many orchards were torched, or destroyed in the two military operations launched to retake the valley, in 2007 and 2009.</p>\r\n<p>Output from Swat\'s fruit farms was worth as high as <STRONG><i><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://frc.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/41.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">$88.5m per year</a></i></STRONG> before the conflict started, but according to surveys carried out following the battle for the valley, farmers say they have suffered losses of about <STRONG><i><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://luskin.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/download-pdfs/Livelihoods,%20basic%20services%20and%20social%20protection%20in%20north-western%20Pakistan%20(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\">67 percent in crop production</a></i></STRONG>.</p>\r\n<p>Foreign and local aid, primarily aimed at reconstruction work, also flooded into Swat following the 2009 operation, which saw more than 1.3 million people forced to flee their homes as the army went village by village, carrying out ground and air operations to push the Taliban out of Swat. Since 2009, USAID, for example, has pledged more than <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://luskin.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/download-pdfs/Livelihoods,%20basic%20services%20and%20social%20protection%20in%20north-western%20Pakistan%20(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><STRONG><i>$236.61m in aid</i></STRONG> to Swat</a> and its adjoining areas, including $9m specifically aimed at reviving the flagging tourism industry. Other notable foreign donors include the <STRONG><i><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.uaepap.org/\" target=\"_blank\">UAE</a></i></STRONG>, Qatar Foundation and various European Union aid initiatives, mainly aimed at agriculture.</p>\r\n<p>The Pakistani government, too, has carried out major reconstruction work in the area since the army retook the valley, rebuilding the basic infrastructure of roads, bridges and schools that were destroyed by years of conflict.</p>\r\n<p>Al Jazeera recently visited the valley, and spoke with farmers, hotel owners and government representatives to get a sense of whether that aid is really making a difference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Khursheed Ali Khan, a native of the village of Qambar, has been involved in fruit farming for more than 40 years.</p>\r\n<p>\"We are just about getting by on fruit farming, but we are not thriving,\" he says. \"The main issue is that there is climate change here - it is getting warmer, so apples don\'t grow as much. And with peaches there are so many diseases that your pocket will be emptied [of money] just spraying them with pesticides.</p>\r\n<p>\"For a farmer here, if you are able to get from one season to the next, then you are doing very well.\"</p>\r\n<p>Fruit orchards, Khan explained, take at least seven years to mature after being cut down - which is part of the reason why today, five years after the war, fruit farmers are still feeling the effects of Taliban rule.</p>\r\n<p>\"I have seen many people who had orchards, and now they\'ve gone into the property business, selling and buying land. And this is why all the land has been destroyed - people have destroyed their fields and built houses over them.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abdur Rahim owns a small shop selling household goods in one of Mingora\'s main markets, and is the president of the district\'s traders federation. For him, the effect of Taliban rule, and the ensuing military operations, was much more far-reaching than simply security.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\"The basic, fundamental thing in business is confidence. Any industry or business cannot run on its resources alone - even big factory owners need to take loans from the government. They buy goods on trust,\" he says.</p>\r\n<p>\"Before the operation, on one phone call,\" he adds, pointing to his phone, \"we would load up trucks with hundreds of thousands of rupees [$1 is approximately 100 Pakistani rupees] worth of goods. Now, after Talibanisation, that trust has been ruined. Due to a handful of people, such a noise has been made around the world that everyone looks at us as terrorists.\"</p>\r\n<p>Rahim says that during the years of unrest, traders and businessmen found different routes and markets for their goods, bypassing Swat altogether. Today, he warns the effects of the widespread unemployment here could be more than just economic.</p>\r\n<p>\"No one has yet looked into why Talibanisation started. One of the reasons was of the system, but the other reason was unemployment. […] when people are unemployed, then they can easily be led astray. If you give some unemployed man Rs10,000 [$100], a Kalashnikov and a mobile phone, then how will they refuse?\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mehmood Aslam Wazir is the second-highest ranking civilian administrator in Swat, and feels that the economic recovery in Swat is meeting the government\'s expectations, despite continuing security concerns for anti-Taliban leaders.</p>\r\n<p>\"The recovery of Swat is on the upward side. You will be seeing that there are lots of hotels and restaurants here, and new ones are also being built. So they must be making a profit. Tourism is our biggest industry and it is being revived,\" he told Al Jazeera.</p>\r\n<p>Wazir pointed to the regularly organised tourism festivals, hosted by the military, as signs that tourists were beginning to return to the valley, and pledged that the civilian government would soon take over the organisation of those activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hanif Khan\'s family has owned the Swat Continental Hotel, a mainstay of Mingora\'s main market, for decades. During the days of Taliban rule, it was at the Swat Continental that journalists, who had been smuggled in, would stay, and during the military operation that followed, it was from here that most television journalists hosted their nightly live shows.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\"The security situation is much better these days, and so business is better these days, too,\" he says. \"We are still about 40 percent below what it used to be in the mid-2000s, though.\"</p>\r\n<p>Khan and several other hotel owners Al Jazeera spoke to blame the state of the roads in Swat, many of which are still being reconstructed, for the restricted flow of tourists.</p>\r\n<p>\"The issue is the roads, especially those going to the scenic areas. That lessens the flow of tourists - if you fix those roads, we probably won\'t be able to control the number of visitors.\"</p>\r\n<p>Khan himself spends little time in Swat, these days, due to continuing <STRONG><i><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/11/pakistan-killings-target-anti-taliban-leaders-swat-201411208203415596.html\" target=\"_blank\">death threats from the Taliban</a></i></STRONG>, but says security threats in Swat are now limited to attacks against specific people, such as his family, who stood up to Fazlullah during his ascent to power.</p>\r\n<p>\"For tourists and outsiders, Swat is completely peaceful.

At the same time, he wants women to be kept away from public spheres of work.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Dalaman said Turkey\'s opposition parties must play a bigger role in tackling sexism of this magnitude.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\"They can help hugely by increasing women\'s political participation and therefore, give women greater influence in positions of power,\" she said. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">But not all Turkish women are on the same page. While educated women in urban areas are furious about what the president said, others are comfortable with Erdogan\'s assumptions, professor Yildiz Ecevit, who specialises in gender studies at the Middle East Technical University in Ankara, told Al Jazeera. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\"[Some women in rural communities] receive social benefits for being stay-at-home mothers and while they might not be happy, as long as the economy is good, and they live a comfortable lifestyle, they are okay with voting for Erdogan,\" Ecevit said.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Fatma Bostan, a lecturer at Mus Alparslan University in eastern Turkey, said Erdogan may have mixed up two distinct concepts.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\"I think we need to clarify what the president said,\" Bostan told Al Jazeera. \"I think he has mixed two things up, sameness and equality.

Private medicine fills the gap and in the best cases, at least for those who can afford it, it can provide a valuable alternative service.</p>\r\n<p>But while there are many legitimate private health providers, there are many more that are completely bogus; unaccredited, unregulated \'quack\' doctors - con artists and criminal scammers for the most part - who ruthlessly exploit the credulity, ignorance and desperation of the poorest and most vulnerable people in society. Indeed they are so prolific that a survey carried out in Nigeria earlier this year found that more than 50 percent of the population had received \'treatment\' from the quacks at one time or another – even people with very serious diseases such as typhoid and malaria.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Professor Alex Dodoo, who monitors patient safety for the World Health Organisation in West Africa and has dealt with quacks for years points out the obvious dangers of dealing with fake doctors:</p>\r\n<p>\"If one is not licensed by the state, anything that one does is illegal. Going to see them is dangerous. Period. Would you sit in an aeroplane where the pilot says \'OK hello, I\'m the pilot, but I\'ve not been licensed!\' No way! You put your health at risk and you can die.\"</p>\r\n<p>But it is something that has long bothered Rosemary Nwaebuni, a reporter who lives and works in Nigeria\'s Delta State. She has encountered many people who have suffered at the hands of fake doctors, particularly women who have been the victim of botched abortions, and she is frustrated that the authorities have not done more to stamp them out.</p>\r\n<p>For this this episode of <em>Africa Investigates</em>, she joined up with Anas Aremeryaw Anas, an award-winning journalist from Ghana, to track down the quacks and gather evidence of their scams.</p>\r\n<p>The duo\'s eye-opening investigation quickly unearthed a host of \'doctors\' and \'nurses\' using forged and fake qualifications and with little or no medical training.</p>\r\n<p>The premises these fake medics operate from are invariably unsanitary and the manifestly phoney \'treatments\' they offer patients risk ending in blindness, poisoning, perforated wombs and even life-threatening disfigurement and death from surgical procedures carried out by people lacking even a modicum of skill or experience. Others fall victim to the quacks\' complete inability to diagnose even the most obvious diseases and conditions; mistakes that are more likely to kill or injure their patients than they ever are to heal them.</p>\r\n<p>Going undercover in the guise of a patient, Rosemary was offered treatment for typhoid and malaria (even though she is perfectly healthy) and an illegal abortion (even though she is not pregnant) by quacks who had no medical qualifications whatsoever but who pretended to be experienced and licensed practitioners.</p>\r\n<p>In one remarkable sting, the <em>Africa Investigates</em> team rented a house and invited local quacks to come and do \'home visits\'. The \'patient\' was again Rosemary, who – with the help of a qualified medic – had learned some symptoms that any genuine doctor would immediately recognise as indications of heart disease. Instead, one after another, the \'quacks\' turned up and after cursory examinations wrongly claimed that Rosemary was suffering from typhoid and malaria (two commonly cited conditions) for which she need expensive drugs that only they could prescribe.</p>\r\n<p>What the fake doctors did not know was that the house was rigged with secret closed circuit cameras and that their every move was being scrutinised by a genuine medical practitioner. The doctor was local to the area and asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, but he was unequivocal in his condemnation of the fakes.</p>\r\n<p>\"This is absolute quackery,\" he said of one of the fakes. \"All he did was just glance at the patient and then made a diagnosis and prescribed medications … To take all barrage of medications for this patient with malaria and typhoid. This is wrong, this is all wrong. These drugs are poison. They cause real damage.\"</p>\r\n<p>The team took this this and other evidence to Dr Alfred Ebiakofa, a senior medical officer working for the Nigerian Ministry of Health. He had always lacked the resources and proof to go after fake doctors but now was able to act. He called in the police to work with Anas who, as the investigation heads to a climax, devised a dramatic scheme to trap one of Nigeria\'s most notorious quacks in the act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watch more <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/africainvestigates/\"><em>Africa Investigates</em></a> for reports by undercover African journalists who face intimidation, beatings and death threats.</p>\r\n<div></div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/26/2014112614713948734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/Images/2014/11/26/2014112614713948734_20.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-27 18:39:24','Al Jazeera',9.08199900,8.67527700,NULL,NULL),(112,'20141126203015245459','http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2014/11/family-says-ferguson-decision-heartbreaking-20141126203015245459.html','Family says Ferguson decision \'heartbreaking\'','Michael Brown\'s parents say jury\'s decision not to charge white officer who killed their unarmed son was \"unbelievable\".','<p>Slain US teenager Michael Brown\'s mother says it has been a \"sleepless, very hard, heartbreaking and unbelievable\'\' time for her since the grand jury\'s decision not to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson for killing her son.</p>\r\n<p>Lesley McSpadden said on Wednesday during an interview on NBC\'s \"Today\" show that she felt that Wilson\'s description of her son as looking demonic during their August 9 confrontation was disrespectful and \"added insult to injury\".</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>The family spoke out after officer Wilson said in his first televised interview since the incident that Brown resembled an angry \"demon\" who had started the confrontation, grabbing for his gun and later rushing toward him.</p>\r\n<p>\"I don\'t believe a word of it.

government in Egypt has blamed the Muslim Brotherhood and its supporters for violence last year that led to the deaths of hundreds of people after former president Mohamed Morsi was deposed from power.</p>\r\n<p>In a report published on Wednesday, the committee examining events during the summer of 2013 blamed supporters of Morsi for 11 incidents of violence during protests.</p>\r\n<p>Thousands of protesters began a sit-in near Cairo’s Rabaa al-Adawiya mosque on July 3 last year, following the military\'s removal of Morsi after protests against his rule on June 30.</p>\r\n<p>The committee said attacks in August against security personnel by hundreds of protesters camped at the Rabaa al-Adawiya and nearby Nahda sit-ins caused some officers to \"lose their focus,\" leading to clashes which left a large number of victims.</p>\r\n<p>It said pro-Morsi supporters fired the first shots at Rabaa, and that the first person to die was a policeman.</p>\r\n<p>The resulting security operation left 607 civilians and eight policemen dead, the report said. The Muslim Brotherhood has said the death toll was far higher.</p>\r\n<p>Security forces used bulldozers to uproot the protest camps after the Interior Ministry warned it would deal firmly with protesters acting \"irresponsibly\".</p>\r\n<p>The report said the large death toll could have been avoided but did not implicate the security forces who fired tear gas and birdshot at protesters.</p>\r\n<p>Fadi al-Qadi, advocacy and communications director for the Middle East and North Africa at Human Rights Watch (HRW), told Al Jazeera the report had exaggerated the role of the protesters.</p>\r\n<p>\"The commission has overstated the so-called violence by protesters who were joining the Rabaa and Nahda sit-ins,\" Qadi said.</p>\r\n<p>Set up by President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi, who ousted Morsi from power, the investigation follows an August report by HRW suggesting Sisi should be investigated for his role in the violence.</p>\r\n<p>The New York-based watchdog called last years\' killings at the two protest camps \"crimes against humanity\" and has called for an international inquiry, urging the UN to look into six incidents involving killings of protesters by security forces.</p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2013/9/13/2013913145554797734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2013/9/13/2013913145554797734_2.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-27 03:58:49','Al Jazeera',30.04441960,31.23571160,NULL,NULL),(131,'20141126141228981157','http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/egypt-temporarily-opens-gaza-border-crossing-20141126141228981157.html','Egypt temporarily opens Gaza border crossing','Rafah crossing reopened for two days as Cairo reports another attack on Egyptian troops in border town of El-Arish.','<p>Egypt has temporarily reopened the Rafah border crossing with Gaza for the first time since its closure in late October after a bombing in the Sinai Peninsula, officials have said.</p>\r\n<p>The crossing, which is the only access point to the Palestinian territory not controlled by Israel, will open for four hours on Wednesday and Thursday, a government official said.</p>\r\n<p>\"The crossing is being opened for two days to help traffic mainly from Egypt to Gaza,\" the official said.</p>\r\n<p>The border has been closed since October 24, when 31 Egyptian soldiers were killed in an ambush in the North Sinai area.</p>\r\n<p>The attack, in an agricultural area northwest of the provincial capital El-Arish, was the deadliest assault on Egyptian security forces since the army deposed former president Mohamed Morsi in July 2013.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, a statement released by Egypt’s Ministry of Interior reported that two police officers and a solider were killed in El-Arish on Wednesday.

','<p>Legend has it that while a fire destroyed the city of Rome, the emperor Nero played his fiddle; he was merrily ignoring the plight of his people. This weekend, it seemed to be Kenya\'s turn to get a taste of what official neglect and disinterest look like. As 28 Kenyans lay dead, murdered in cold-blood by terrorists, President Uhuru Kenyatta was wining and dining with the <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/201411250310.html\" target=\"_blank\">jet set in Abu Dhabi</a>, enjoying the trapping of a Formula 1 weekend.</p>\r\n<p>But things are not always as they seem. The fact is, it is not that Kenyatta\'s government was disinterested in security. It is that its understanding of what constitutes a national security threat is radically different from what most Kenyans would expect.</p>\r\n<p>The events immediately preceding and following the massacre of bus passengers in the town of Mandera, near Kenya\'s border with Somalia, have amply demonstrated why Kenya\'s security is in the toilet. Days before the atrocity happened, county government officials had been <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://sabahionline.com/en_GB/articles/hoa/articles/features/2014/11/18/feature-01\" target=\"_blank\">warning of the threat of an attack</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\"We have strong intelligence which we have shared with security authorities, but we are disappointed that the authorities are not taking us seriously,\" Mandera County Governor Ali Roba complained.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Policing, not protecting</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>Instead of reinforcing security at the border town, the government dispatched officers to the Kenyan coast, where a series of raids on several mosques had apparently turned up a small cache of weapons including pistols, grenades and petrol bombs. More than 360 people had been arrested in the night-time raids, including some as young as 12, with many claiming to have been taken from their homes. As a result, according to one report, at the time the Mandera attack happened, \"<a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.nation.co.ke/news/-/1056/2532898/-/15rhwriz/-/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">there were only four officers in the area</a>\".</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p>It is not difficult to guess why police would be withdrawn from an area under imminent threat of terrorist attack to one where the government had just closed several mosques, arrested and alienated huge numbers of people and where attacks on non-Muslim communities had already been carried out. The problem the authorities are concerned about is not the external one from the Somalia-based armed group, al-Shabab, but rather the internal one from disaffected, disillusioned and radicalised citizens.</p>\r\n<p>The government has tended to deal with the citizenry as the primary source of national security threat, which it defines as the threat to itself and to its authority, not to the people. It thus has shown no compunction about demonising entire communities, from Somali refugees and citizens of Somali origin, to Muslims, to the marginalised communities across the north and in the west of the country.</p>\r\n<p>From their founding, the Kenyan security institutions have been set up to police, not to protect local communities. The security system is a colonial era edifice that has not been fundamentally reformed and continues to prioritise the protection of the rapacious interests of a tiny and powerful elite over the rights and safety of the rest of the country. These elites have actively resisted any attempt to reform the system. They have actively sought to undermine the 2010 constitution which enshrined a bill of rights and articulated a new security structure.</p>\r\n<p>Laws reforming the security structure, when they have been passed, have either been ignored, or amended so as to detract from their original purpose. There have there been legislative moves to turn oversight bodies into mere paperweights, which would only confirm the reality that they are ignored anyway. For example, the Independent Policing Oversight Authority has noted gaps in the implementation of legislation meant to streamline the National Police Service and demanded the resignation of the inspector general of police over the inability to deal with insecurity, but it now <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/campus/story/2000139914/police-officers-want-bully-watchdog-shown-the-door\" target=\"_blank\">finds itself threatened with dissolution</a>.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>\'A personal challenge\'</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>The result of this is that the elite have continued to have a free hand to exploit the resources of the country at the expense of its population. Kenya\'s elephant and rhino populations are being hunted to extinction while the government protects those most responsible for the carnage. The country has been turned into a major conduit for illegal drugs and <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.trust.org/item/20131209150854-1kirf/?source=spotlight\" target=\"_blank\">a destination for illicit money</a>. Further, it has fallen to the international community to step into the breach created by the inaction of Kenyan authorities and to attempt to prosecute some of those responsible for the mass murder of Kenyans, as well as the corruption that impoverishes them. Predictably, such moves have been met with either foot-dragging or outright opposition from the government.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>It is plain that a government run by people who see the rest of the populace as a threat to their position and to their opportunities to extract rents, will not be too motivated to protect them. In fact, Kenyatta\'s administration has tended to treat insecurity not as a security threat, but a public relations problem. The government has, for example, been slow to respond to the widespread incidents of violence against women, with half-hearted reactions when public outrage over incidents of women being assaulted and stripped in public made the news.</p>\r\n<p>Terrorist attacks have inspired little other than strong words and perplexing declarations of victory (such as we heard after the attack on the Westgate Mall) and sometimes, outright lies. In the aftermath of the attacks on Mpeketoni, near the coastal town of Lamu, the president got into <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://blogs.aljazeera.com/blog/africa/kenya-mpeketoni-attack-who-fooling-who\" target=\"_blank\">an unseemly tussle with al-Shabab</a> whose claim of responsibility had complicated his own efforts to lay the blame on \"local political networks\", which is shorthand for the opposition.</p>\r\n<p>In a statement issued on behalf of the president following the Mandera attack, Deputy President William Ruto was quick to congratulate the security forces for protecting Kenyans (go figure!) and, without offering any proof, repeat claims that many other attacks had been stopped and that in the particular case of the Mandera attackers, the security forces had caught up with them and killed 100 of them. As evidence for the latter, the government appeared to have released pictures bearing a time stamp from two years ago.</p>\r\n<p>An address to a high level security seminar given by the president just hours before the killing of 22 officers illustrates his propensity to see national security purely through the prism of his own \"personal challenge\" as he once described his prosecution at the International Criminal Court. It is peppered with references to the fight against foreign domination and demonises civil society organisations, which have pushed for his case not to be prematurely abandoned.</p>\r\n<p>So when informed of the attack in Mandera, Kenyatta did not think it prudent to skip the Formula 1 race and dash home to deal with the security crisis simply because he does not consider the murder of Kenyans a security crisis. The problem is not that he is fiddling while Kenya burns. It is rather that despite all evidence to the contrary, he does not think that Kenya is burning.</p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i>Patrick Gathara is a strategic communications consultant, writer, and award-winning political cartoonist based in Nairobi. </i></STRONG></em></p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/images/2014/11/26//20141126113934782734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/images/2014/11/26/20141126113934782734_20.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-27 01:53:10','Patrick Gathara',3.93563890,41.85511620,NULL,NULL),(134,'20141126104721746389','http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/11/ukraine-rapidly-growing-idp-problem-20141126104721746389.html','Ukraine\'s rapidly growing IDP problem','Some 473,000 Ukrainians have been displaced as fighting continues - nearly double from two months ago, UN says.','<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><STRONG><i>Lviv, Ukraine -</i></STRONG> </span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Renata Proshunina sits on the edge of the bed in her small hotel room, nursing her four-month-old son, Emin.

In arid northern Argentina, people have only one source of fuel; wood. It is often scrawny bushes that are increasingly hard to find. But the region also has a huge untapped resource – solar radiation – and Virginia Bauso’s mission is to harness its potential and promote solar energy as the main power source for entire villages: from kitchens and ovens to heating, lighting, hot water and even a public phone.</p>\r\n<p>She roams the desert spreading innovative technology, including a “kiosk” she invented that cooks food using the sun’s rays. The community of Misa Rumi is now almost 100 percent solar-functional. Another village recently built a solar quinoa dryer, creating new opportunities for employment.</p>\r\n<p>As deforestation and desertification continue to ravage Argentina and beyond, Bauso’s vision could play a major role in charting a sustainable path to energy independence. This film will explore how solar energy improves rural life on multiple levels by documenting its impact – in the fields of agriculture, education, health and business, as well as power – and contrasting this with isolated communities that are yet to adopt Bauso’s groundbreaking tools.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><em>Seizing Solar Power </em>can be seen from <STRONG><i><STRONG><i><STRONG><i>Sunday, <STRONG><i><STRONG><i>December 7 <STRONG><i><STRONG><i><STRONG><i>at the following times GMT: <STRONG><i><STRONG><i>Sunday: 2230; Monday: 0930; Tuesday: 0330 and Wednesday: 1630.</i></STRONG></i></STRONG></i></STRONG></i></STRONG></i></STRONG></i></STRONG></i></STRONG></i></STRONG></i></STRONG></i></STRONG></i></STRONG></p>\r\n\r\n<p><STRONG><i></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>Asmahan, a Syrian Druze princess, emerged as an Egyptian siren in the ‘40s.

Those who start these businesses, where they are making sweets or have a sewing business, that\'s not seen as part of the formal economy; they are not officially part of the Libyan work force. And it\'s a large group of women who choose to work that way,\" explains Murabit.</p>\r\n<p>According to recent figures, only 20 percent of women in Libya take part in civic or political activity of any kind.</p>\r\n<p>Of Libya\'s working women, 73 percent choose careers in education or medicine. Hikmat Kmishi is the coordinator of Women for Democratic Transformation (WDT), a Tripoli-based network that encourages prospective female politicians. She affirmed that women tend to work in two main sectors.</p>\r\n<p>\"Most women become doctors or teachers. We certainly don\'t have many female politicians,\" explains Kmishi, who holds cultural factors responsible for this trend. </p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\"Women are not traditionally in the public sphere, and while they are given jobs, rarely are they put in decision-making positions. It\'s the mindset, people still think women can\'t do a lot.\"</p>\r\n<p>Kmishi is one of many women who think that cultural practices are negatively affecting the female workforce, and it\'s a factor that arises for Libyan women in various sectors.</p>\r\n<p>Assia Amry works for Aramex, a global logistics and transportation provider. She is the manager of their Tripoli branch. She grew up in the US but moved to Libya in June 2012 with her father, who had been part of an anti-Gaddafi dissident movement.</p>\r\n<p>\"My team are all men,\" says Amry. \"At first I think they were amused at the idea of being led by a woman, but [they] eventually accepted it … and it\'s great.\"</p>\r\n<p>Amry explained that while there are some women in managerial positions in Libya, senior roles are overwhelmingly awarded to men. As a result, female employees can at times be overlooked. \"The biggest challenge is with customers,\" she said.</p>\r\n<p>\"A lot of times when customers have issues, they will say \'I want to talk to the manager,\' but they don\'t realise I am the manager, and it\'s usually satisfying for me to tell them that.\"</p>\r\n<p>The number of women working in Libya\'s private sector is low at nine percent, but not necessarily because women are actively being discouraged to enter the work force, according to Amry.</p>\r\n<p>\"It\'s not because in Libyan culture, women are taught not to achieve, or work; I just think Libya, in all aspects, is evolving… Libyan women are go-getters, they are looking for opportunities.\"</p>\r\n<p>Beyond pre-existing social factors, Libya\'s ongoing political turmoil has restricted freedom of movement for women across the country and in turn, discouraged women from entering politics.</p>\r\n<p>Noor El Huda Gleasa, 23, is a communications manager for Creative International Associates, an NGO that facilitates voter education and promotes civic engagement.</p>\r\n<p>She works across 16 different cities in Libya. \"If a woman wants to work in politics or in a job that\'s in the spotlight, the security issues they face are much more severe than men,\" Gleasa told Al Jazeera. \"It puts women in an incredibly difficult position.\"</p>\r\n<p>Similarly, Hanan Salah, the Libya Researcher for Human Rights Watch, pointed out that the ongoing conflict and lack of security across the country is the main issue affecting Libyan women\'s ability to work.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p> \"There have been several instances this past year where, due to the complete lack of law and order in parts of Libya, various militias and individuals are taking matters into their own hands by trying to prohibit women from travelling on their own without a male companion,\" Salah told Al Jazeera.</p>\r\n<p>\"Some militias have been harassing women on university campuses. We have examples of women who have been forced to stop their studies because of the impunity that these militias and individuals are benefiting from.\"</p>\r\n<p>In short, the instability that has spread across Libya means that women\'s basic physical access to employment has been affected and this impacts the careers they pursue.</p>\r\n<p>\"The reason a lot of women choose to be teachers isn\'t because they all had a particularly strong desire to be teachers, but it\'s because schools are everywhere and are easily accessible,\" Murabit said.</p>\r\n<p>\"For women who don\'t have a husband or brother who will drive them everywhere, it\'s very difficult for them to have a corporate job downtown, because they would need transportation and Libyan public transportation is very poor.\"</p>\r\n<p>Murabit said this issue could easily be solved if the Libyan government invested in safe public transportation for women as well as establishing more locally based occupations.</p>\r\n<p>\"There is a heavy reliance on what is a local and safe job, and these are primarily as educators, which is great for our future generations -

Nothing seems to work. We can make Twitter hashtags. We can bring up all the statistics we like. We can talk about the string of recent deaths of black men (and one <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/23/cleveland-police-shoot-dead-12-year-old-boy-carrying-fake-gun\" target=\"_blank\">12-year-old boy</a>). And in return, we are told to shut up. US social media is now full of angry white people who demand that we stop talking about racism.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>But everyone seems to be missing the point, which I believe I have discovered: Black people are not <em>people</em>. They are not even three-fifths of a person, as some of us seem fond of saying. Blacks are apparently nothing more than fantasy creatures - demons, savages, comic book characters.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span>We\'ve seen this movie before</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span>On Monday, a grand jury failed to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in the shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black boy. This was confirmed at 1 pm, but the information was </span><span>not released until 9 pm. Why did the <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/11/25/7279379/ferguson-grand-jury-timing\" target=\"_blank\">authorities wait until the evening</a> to announce the decision? Because they knew that crowd control is more difficult at night, and that night shots of fires and police/protester standoffs would be more dramatic than daytime ones? Were the lives of thousands - civilians and police alike - put at risk, all in the name of PR, because they needed a diversion?</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span>In the end, they got what they wanted. A building caught fire, which gave news stations an excuse to run \"Ferguson in Flames\" headlines, to ignore thousands of peacefully protesting citizens to focus on looters, to report about police cars burning but ignore </span><span><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://bpicampus.com/2014/11/25/morning-feature-bob-mccollouchs-riot/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>police scanner reports</span></a><span> that a main suspect was a white male.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span>Watching things play out in Ferguson has been like watching a bad movie after a friend spoils the plot for you. That is why in all of the articles that have come out after the verdict, there is none of the original urgency that we saw during the first weeks after the shooting. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>After all, we\'ve all seen this one before, haven\'t we? White cop shoots black thug, black thugs riot, Al Sharpton says something, people forget, credits roll.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>So, it\'s no wonder non-Americans tend to think that real life in the US is just like it is in violent Hollywood movies - because it often is. But this doesn\'t mean that other countries have picked up our bad habit of frantically demonising blacks in the news. Watching foreign news treatment of Michael Brown is particularly illuminating. In Japan, newscasters call him \"Brown-san\", using the honorific suffix \"-san\" out of respect. In Mexican coverage, he\'s referred to as a \"joven\", in Brazil, a \"jovem\", in Taiwan, a \"xiaonian\" - all words for a \"young man\". In other words, he is treated as a person.</span></p>\r\n<p>But in the US, we are warned that <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-28929087\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Brown \"<span>was no angel</span>\"</a>. We are told that he made rap songs. We are reminded that he was quite tall (just as tall as his killer), and a bit overweight (this part makes him scary). <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://fox2now.com/2014/08/15/was-michael-brown-enrolled-in-college/\" target=\"_blank\">Fox News has worked to cast doubt</a> on whether he was headed to college or not. Any facade of humanity that Brown might have had has been stripped away, all the better to show us the terrifying monster within.<STRONG><i></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span>Killing our demons</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span>In his testimony, Officer Darren Wilson, the man who shot Michael Brown, said of the victim that \"</span><span><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/25/darren-wilson-testimony_n_6216620.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span>it look[ed] like a demon</span></a>\"<span>. That is, not only was Brown a \"demon\", but an \"it\".</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span>Granted, Wilson may have misspoken. He probably meant \"he\" instead of \"it\". But, this is a man who has sworn to protect the lives of his fellow citizens. He has also had weeks to receive the finest media training available. This was, to put it neutrally, a very delicate case. If it did not occur to him or his handlers that referring to a dead boy as \"it\", \"a demon\", or \"the threat\" in public was a bad idea, does that not suggest that perhaps something might be wrong with the way Ferguson police interact with the citizenry?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>But none of this matters, because Michael Brown was not a person. He was a demon, and apparently, a comic book character.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span>At another point in the testimony, Wilson said that Brown \"looked like he was almost bulking up to run through the shots, like it was making him mad that I\'m shooting at him\". </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Nobody seems to know what \"bulking up\" even means. I\'ve only heard it in terms of sports - athletes eat more and workout during the off-season so as to \"bulk up\" and be more muscular and competitive come game time. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>But \"bulking up\" isn\'t something that one instantaneously does after being shot once, nor in order to prepare to run through a hail of bullets. Really, this doesn\'t sound like a testimony, it sounds like the plot line of </span><span><em><span>The Incredible Hulk</span></em><span>.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span>To be honest, Wilson\'s story doesn\'t make any sense to me</span><span>, but I\'ll never know the truth now, because the US was denied a trial. So, I\'m afraid I have to agree with all of the racists. Perhaps whatever Wilson saw that day wasn\'t human. There might have been a human out there in the street, but Wilson didn\'t see him. He saw a demon, and it\'s hard to blame him, because that\'s all we seem to see.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span>Black people may be dying, but white activism isn\'t</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span>One common insult thrown at the youth of the US is that we are too apathetic, and not capable of starting a social movement. This is simply not true. Americans have not lost their ability to organise. Over the past few months, we have launched two rather impressive online-based movements: the Ice Bucket Challenge</span><span><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.alsa.org/fight-als/ice-bucket-challenge.html\" target=\"_blank\"></a><span>, and GamerGate.</span><span> In the first, millions made viral videos of themselves pouring cold water over their heads to raise money to find a cure for a debilitating disease called ALS. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>In the second, a group of (<a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/technology-science/technology/stop-gamergate-hate-mob-pleads-4534231\" target=\"_blank\">largely misogynist</a>) </span><span>video game enthusiasts were able to get such multinational companies as Intel and Adobe to pull sponsorships from major technology media sites, all in the name of \"ethical journalism\". Both movements were predominantly white.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>But, I\'m not sure if we should expect a widespread movement of white internet activists pushing companies to stop sponsoring biased real-life news programmes, or donating money to stop police brutality. In the latter case, we\'ve actually seen the opposite - a <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.alternet.org/activism/pressure-grows-gofundme-stop-its-support-officer-darren-wilson-campaign\" target=\"_blank\">\"Support Darren Wilson\" campaign raised</a> <span>nearly a half million dollars</span><span>, with some contributors thanking Wilson for, among other things, \"protecting normal Americans from aggressive and entitled primitive savages\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span>After all, we live in an age where many Americans will gleefully dump ice water on their heads in front of a video camera, but become angry the moment someone brings up the possibility that Brown\'s case might have been mishandled. In other words, a sizable portion of the population would rather risk hypothermia, heart arrhythmia, and death than endure the emotional discomfort of considering blacks as humans.</span></p>\r\n<p>Instead, Americans prefer to consider blacks as fantasy characters, because this makes our expectations of them seem reasonable. We adore them as entertainers, but despise them as neighbours. We want them to sing loudly, but die quietly.</p>\r\n<p><span>Fifty years ago, a writer named James Baldwin said that Americans needed to recognise that the humanity of the \"submerged population\" of blacks was equal to the humanity of anyone else. I fear that Baldwin may have overestimated our sense of compassion and responsibility.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>It may be too early, or too late, to think of the US race problem as whites being \"more\", and blacks being \"less\" human. I\'m afraid that we may need to begin by deciding whether blacks are human at all.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i>Dexter Thomas, Jr is a scholar of hip-hop and contemporary culture at Cornell University.

The most famous example of this is the sentimentalised, and much misunderstood, Spanish Civil War which drew thousands of idealistic adventures to both sides.</span></p>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">More recently, similar motives led the<a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/sep/15/iraq.features\" target=\"_blank\"> renowned journalist Jason Burke, to join the Kurds in Iraq</a> in their struggle against Saddam Hussein.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN\">\"It was the end of my second year at university and the Gulf War had just finished.

Hence reports describing these two Britons as such are mistaken. The likelihood is they would have financed their own journey to northern Syria, bought their own weapons and can only expect basic sustenance in return for their efforts. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">Combat also draws, as it creates, a handful of psychopaths. One of the key protagonists of the 1972 Northern Ireland Bloody Sunday shooting was the Greek Cypriot Costas Georgiou. After ultimately having been dishonourably discharged from the British army for robbing a post office, he joined the civil war in Angola where he infamously executed his own men before he was, in turn, executed by the victorious People\'s Movement for the Liberation of Angola <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">(MPLA</span>).</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">Yet inexplicable as it may seem to many, the mere thrill of combat is often the primary motivating factor. While ideological reasons are cited in justification, the real reason many individuals travel abroad to fight is an age old search of adventure. This more than anything may have played its part in luring westerners to the Kurdish cause, just as others before them went to Bosnia or Rhodesia. The difference being, this time the war against ISIL provides a useful pretext for their actions.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\"><STRONG><i>Personal endeavour</i></STRONG> </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">Regardless of the motives for joining a foreign conflict, it is ultimately a personal endeavour that rarely brings much benefit to the side whose cause has been adopted particularly, as in this instance, when the numbers involved are so small.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">Unless an individual has a specific and sought after set of skills, such as being a doctor, mechanic, engineer or weapons specialist, it is difficult for them to make a significant contribution. Even the expert training former western soldiers might bring to this conflict will be negated by their inability to communicate with their Kurdish counterparts.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">The fact is only foreign governments can really help in the fight against ISIL. The coalition air strikes, the equipment being provided by the German government or the large scale training missions currently under discussion between Erbil and the US government, are ultimately of infinite more value than the contribution of individuals. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">That said, the arrival of these westerners alongside the battling YPG is not without benefit. Their presence will undoubtedly raise morale and bring much welcome publicity to the cause, even if this may be offset by ISIL\'s claims that their fight is now against western invaders. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">For now, the involvement of western fighters on the Kurdish front lines is little more than a news story and counter-narrative to the many thousands of foreigners from across the world who have joined ISIL. If they are to have any effect, then they must hope that their example somehow galvanises thousands of others. Otherwise, their contribution will remain little more than symbolic. </span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">Crispian Cuss is a former British Army officer who has worked and lived in the Middle East.

On August 9, Wilson, a white policeman, shot and killed Michael Brown, while the 18-year-old black teen was walking down the street in Ferguson, Missouri. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">During the 110 days since Brown was pronounced dead, Ferguson has vividly revealed the US\' racial faultlines, unveiled its stark, systemic inequities, and showcased to the world the racial sectarianism that still stratifies and segregates people in the US. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\"A system cannot fail those it was never built to protect,\" wrote W.E.B. Dubois, indicting structural inequity and exclusion as the very seeds that rear racial segregation. Dubois\' US was marred by formal segregation. A segregation that not only marked black and brown Americans as inferior; but relentlessly exposed them to legal processes that vilified their racial identities, and exonerated their assailants. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Exactly 110 years later, Dubois\' words have never been more prescient. The thinker\'s words foretell a divide that continues to fracture the US along racial lines, and exposes its most marginalised communities to structures that continuously persecute - rather than protect - them. Racial inequities on the ground, perpetuated by politics, law and their slanted processes, drive the racial sectarianism that marred the US at its inception, middle and current passages.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">US\' tribal divisions</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\"Sectarianism\" may seem both geographically and conceptually foreign to the modern American experience. First, it connotes a primordial and tribal division commonly used to characterise <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/06/world/middleeast/power-struggles-in-middle-east-exploit-islams-ancient-sectarian-rift.html\" target=\"_blank\">warring factions in the Middle East</a> or the \"Muslim world\". Second, it is a discord and division almost exclusively linked to religion. </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Yet, if religious rifts are the primary lines of conflict in the Middle East, then the US\' ungodly racial divide looms as its most salient spaces of tension and violence, discord and disenfranchisement. Racism historically, and still today, stands as the US\' sectarianism.    </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">American sectarianism is nurtured by two complimentary myths. The first holds that, \"racism is individual and aberrational\", stripping political, economic, and legal structures from any responsibility in perpetuating racial inequality. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The second myth contends that these very structures are \"colour-blind and objective systems, which function without racial bias\". Together, these myths not only caricature the meaning of racism, and vastly narrow its scope, but more importantly, conceal how government structures continually reinforce the US\' racial sectarianism. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The population of <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/08/15/how-ferguson-exposes-the-racial-bias-in-local-elections/\" target=\"_blank\">Ferguson is 67 percent black</a>. However, 50 of its 53 policemen, including Wilson, are white. The grand jury, which ultimately decided to bring no charges, comprised <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/grand-jury-in-michael-brown-case-black-members-white/article_6bbba56c-e28a-53d0-8b85-b20c36810fbd.html\" target=\"_blank\">nine whites and three black members</a>. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Ferguson was only demographically a \"black community\". Its political institutions, police force, and grand jury were overwhelmingly white. Therefore, racial division in Ferguson aligned neatly with power disparities, which became blatantly clear when the grand jury rendered a definition of justice that served the interests of one officer, Wilson, instead of the collective concerns of the 14,200 black residents of Ferguson. Blacks simply lived in Ferguson, while whites controlled it.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Asymmetrical sectarianism</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">In both its religious and racial form, sectarianism is seldom symmetrical. Typically, one faction holds comparative supremacy within the halls of power, and therefore, manipulates legal processes to its advantage and to the detriment of its rival faction. Popular illustrations of war-torn Arab and Muslim states overwhelmingly centre on the sectarian splits, which consequently simplify the distinct and complicated crises taking place from state to state.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Yet, American racial hostilities and division is manifested by embedded and still <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/fisher-v-university-of-texas-at-austin/\" target=\"_blank\">growing racial segregation in virtually every major US city</a>; the consistent assault and erosion of affirmative action by the courts and through the ballot box; an aggregate prison population that is <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/US/tamir-rices-toy-gun-indistinguishable-real-gun-cops/story?id=27137979\" target=\"_blank\">61 percent black and Latino</a>; and police officers that profile, persecute and slay black and brown youth without punishment.     </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">While neatly crafted myths perpetuate a thin veneer of racial harmony, Ferguson offers a sharp dose of the US\' unequal reality, which pierces through that veneer to reveal the racial sectarianism that still divides the US. A sectarianism where the most vulnerable are victimised, the racially excluded are vast villains, and the law and its processes are deployed to deepen primordial racial inequities. The nihilism and hopelessness embodied by protesters in Ferguson are, echoing Dubois, bred by a system that continuously strips a people of its dignity.     </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Racial rifts and conflicts continue to fortify US sectarianism. A sectarianism that simultaneously rips this country apart as we gaze eastward, and ridicule distant peoples for their backward, tribal and primal divides - which deters us acknowledging our own sectarian crisis, even as it unfolds in our own back yards and on our televisions.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Khaled A.

','<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Americans are used to turning on the nightly news to see violence, unrest and angry protesters in some far away land. We like to pretend that those kinds of problems happen in \"other\" nations and that Americans would never feel so angry, trapped or disenfranchised that violence would seem like the only option for expression. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">However, after tonight\'s ruling by the St Louis County grand jury to not indict Officer Darren Wilson for the shooting death of Michael Brown, those images of violence, burning buildings and protests are again coming from the United States and not some \"other\" nation. And without some serious work on the broken and dysfunctional government in the US events like Ferguson will be more frequent in the future.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>In the US there are three levels of government that overlap in the lives of most citizens, local government, state government and federal government. In most cases these levels of governance operate independently of each other, only interacting in the event of a crisis or a project too big to be handled by any one entity. A huge summer hurricane can\'t be handled by the state alone, so the federal government offers aid and assistance. The federal government seeks to fight Ebola, but needs local hospitals and cities to implement healthcare standards. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>In other words, when these levels of government work together the nation moves smoothly, concerns and crises are mitigated, and citizens feel both respected and invested in their community. None of that happened in Ferguson, Missouri, which is why riots and social unrest have rocked the town and as a consequence the nation for months. </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span>Conflict of interest</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span>When Michael Brown was first shot, the response of the local government was so inept, so tone deaf and so over the top that the initial riots were all but guaranteed. Initially, the Ferguson police department allowed <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/why-was-michael-brown-s-body-left-there-for-hours/article_0b73ec58-c6a1-516e-882f-74d18a4246e0.html\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Brown\'s body to lie</a> in the middle of a residential neighbourhood uncovered, for hours, which both disturbed and enraged the local community. </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span>Rather than respond or engage the concerns of the mostly African American Third Ward of Ferguson, police showed up in riot gear, with machine guns and armoured tanks. This, in the absence of any explanation for the shooting, only perpetuated the idea that the government didn\'t serve the local community. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>To make matters worse, the mayor of Ferguson never required the local police to release a written police report to the public, despite that being standard practice, and the mayor spent more time on national television and radio programmes than he did talking to local activists who may have given some real insight into why Ferguson residents felt the way that they did. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Had the problems with government action begun and ended with local incompetence perhaps some of the tragedies in Ferguson could have been prevented. The state or perhaps federal government could have stepped in and corrected local mistakes. Unfortunately, poor oversight, lack of consistency, and gross negligence continued up the chain of government. The county prosecutor, Bob McCulloch, assigned to the Darren Wilson case had a <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/gov-jay-nixon-wont-replace-controversial-prosecutor-michael-brown-case-265756\" target=\"_blank\">clear conflict of interest</a>; so despite the fact that getting an indictment is a fairly easy task many questioned if he would properly perform his duties. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Officer Wilson shot an unarmed teenager and there was conflicting eyewitness testimony, and under US law, an indictment is a jury simply saying there is enough ambiguity in a story that a trial is necessary to determine the truth. Given the clear conflict of interest and the stakes being an indictment not a verdict on innocence or guilt, Governor Nixon should have assigned another prosecutor to the case. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>However, he refused to do so, not only bringing the entire trial into question but symbolically telling the citizens of Ferguson concerned over the Brown shooting that their concerns were irrelevant. </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span>Crisis of faith</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span>Unfortunately, the problems don\'t stop with the governor, President Barack Obama can be held accountable for what happened in Ferguson after the grand jury decision as well. After seeing the overly aggressive behaviour of Ferguson police against protesters and the press back in August, the president suggested a review of the federal political militarisation of the police known as Program 1033. But the president did not follow up, and the review <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/evanmcsan/white-house-police-demilitarization\" target=\"_blank\">died in the corridors of Washington</a>. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>So is it any surprise that after the grand jury verdict, the local Ferguson police force was right back to shooting smoke bombs and tear gas, using armoured tanks and arbitrarily changing protest routes and restrictions, all but provoking a new conflict? </span></p>\r\n<p><span>On the ground in Ferguson I witnessed hundreds of protesters of all colours and ages marching through the streets of the town and in surrounding areas. The true tragedy was not that they were upset about the grand jury decision to not even indict Darren Wilson. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>The vast majority of the men and women that I spoke to were not surprised by the grand jury decision, even if they disagreed with it. The real tragedy is that so few Americans, of all colours, believed that the local police, mayor, prosecutor, governor or president of the United States, were actually interested in or capable of delivering any sort of justice in the shooting of Michael Brown. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>There is a crisis of faith in the US government, from Washington to main street US. When a people lack faith, lack hope in the men and women they\'ve elected to power to actually represent their interests, violence and open conflict are not far behind. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Unless there is a fundamental change in how Americans view their government, unless government accountability becomes more than an election year slogan or an excuse to cut programmes, government abuses like Ferguson will continue. And the Americans\' distanced view of \"other\" nations\' problems will come crashing through TV screens from far more cities than just Ferguson. </span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i>Dr Jason Johnson is a professor of political science at Hiram College.

They would point to the fact that the US is silent about nuclear stockpiles in Israel and Pakistan despite the serious security threats emanating from both countries. Iran insists it has the right to develop nuclear energy under the terms of its international treaties. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Obama admitted in his interview that there\'s going to be \"a long path towards normalisation of our relationship with Iran\". It seems as though the lack of mutual trust between Iran and the US may take longer to heal. The hope is that at the Vienna talks the first steps towards that long path were taken and that as promised by Kerry, negotiations over the next seven months would bear a specific goal of reaching that political agreement. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\"We have seen new ideas surface,\" said Kerry in his final statement to the press in Vienna. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\"We are not going to use all the seven months,\" said Foreign Minister Zarif. \"We\'d like to reach a political agreement as soon as possible.\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">In a joint statement, EU envoy Catherine Ashton and Zarif also spoke of those \"new ideas\" that need to be explored. Those new ideas and the resolve to continue to work intensively on a new narrative both in Iran and in the West over improving mutual trust would perhaps be the only hope for a real political agreement in seven months. Otherwise another chance would be passed over to those threatening words that \"all options are on the table\".</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Dr Massoumeh Torfeh is former director of strategic communication at the UN Assistance Mission for Afghanistan (UNAMA) and is currently a research associate at the London School of Economics and Political Science, specialising in Iran, Afghanistan and Central Asia.</span></i></STRONG></em></p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/25/20141125114252843734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/Images/2014/11/25/20141125114252843734_20.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-26 00:11:41','Al Jazeera',48.20817430,16.37381890,NULL,NULL),(180,'201411255372460761','http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/2014/11/russia-crackdown-crimea-muslims-201411255372460761.html','Russia\'s crackdown on Crimea\'s Muslims','Tatars resisted Moscow\'s annexation of the Black Sea peninsula in March, and the Muslim community has paid for it since.','<div style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"justify\"><strong style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><br /></i></STRONG></div>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"justify\"><strong style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Putilovka, Crimea </i></STRONG>-<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> The search warrant accused Muslyadin Muslyadinov of killing a Ukrainian riot police officer, although the dozen armed masked men who surrounded his modest whitewashed house in this mountain village in southern Crimea were sent by Russian authorities.</span></div>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> </span></div>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">They found the full-bearded, gray-haired, 54-year-old in a barn milking cows, but did not arrest him for the murder allegedly committed in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, during anti-Russian protests early this year.

All we need is permission. Islam had developed and spread on the continent even before Columbus arrived.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Erdogan has always enjoyed challenging common narratives. In doing so, he appeals to Muslim public opinion both domestically and internationally. Despite recent setbacks, he still believes that he represents the Muslim world. In Turkey, his remarks were widely discussed in the pro-Erdogan media where some overzealous journalists even tried to substantiate his claims. <em>Aksam</em> newspaper, for instance, went further by detailing \"evidence\" of the presence of Islam in the Americas well before Columbus. As for the average man on the street, he certainly relished the idea of a Muslim at the forefront of American history - as revised by Erdogan.    </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Stands by his claim</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">A few days later, following a flood of sarcastic commentaries in media outlets across the globe, Erdogan - rather than retract, spin or clarify his bizarre assertion - insisted he was right.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\"<span lang=\"TR\"><a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://t24.com.tr/haber/cumhurbaskani-erdogan-ankarada-konusuyor,277467\" target=\"_blank\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">I told them that Muslims discovered the American continent 300 years before Columbus</span></a></span>.

Even grownups: We have columnists writing, cartoonists drawing against [this assertion]. Why? Because they don\'t believe a Muslim can achieve such a deed… This is lack of self-confidence,\" he told journalists, adding that he instructed the Ministry of Education to <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/erdogan-vows-to-teach-turkish-children-muslim-discovery-of-americas.aspx?pageID=238&nID=74485&NewsCatID=338\" target=\"_blank\">revise history textbooks accordingly</a>.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> And with these words, Erdogan defied the critics and satirists, and stood by his assertion that the Americas were discovered by Muslims in the 12th century.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">What a conversion for a politician who, in 2005, was the initiator, together with then Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Zapatero, of the so-called Alliance of Civilisations as an interfaith initiative to counter Samuel Huntington\'s theory on the \"Clash of Civilisations\" in the post-September 11 era. At the time, relations between Muslims and Christians - as well as Jews - were tense. Erdogan was the thriving prime minister of a Turkey that was touted as the model of nascent \"Muslim democracy\". He was negotiating with the European Union for full membership. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">What country other than Turkey could have been the architect of such an initiative? The project was later adopted by the United Nations as a UN initiative called the United Nations Alliance of Civilisations (UNAOC). Within this framework, Erdogan and Zapatero co-sponsored several meetings around the world putting the emphasis on a common understanding between Islam and other religions on both humanitarian and social matters. Intercultural dialogue was the catchphrase of the hour.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Muslim proselytiser</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Let\'s fast forward to today: Erdogan is now president, but he appears to act more like a Muslim proselytiser, proposing to build mosques wherever he goes, boasting about achievements by Muslims in our day and in the past and adopting a style with patent religious undertones. As he puts it, he has become <span lang=\"TR\"><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.diyanet.gov.tr/en/content/first-latin-american-countries-muslim-leaders-summit-ends/22358\" target=\"_blank\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">a kind of \"missionary\" of the Muslim world</span></a></span>, constantly instilling confidence, but often at the expense of the facts and of the other faiths: \"Our duty is to inform about the Almighty until our last dying breath and invite people to the path of Allah.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">This shift in Erdogan\'s policy (and behaviour) has already been noticed by the successors of Zapatero, who left power in 2011, a date which also corresponds to the beginning of Erdogan\'s openly authoritarian way of ruling domestically. The successor government in Spain has put on hold its participation in the <span>UNAOC</span>, while the project continues under UN auspices but with less and less impact, especially given the recent chaos and bloodshed in the Middle East.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">With Erdogan\'s recent shenanigans, international public opinion received a confirmation of this shift as extensively reported by Spanish media along with other media outlets in Europe and the Americas. It is highly significant that a respected Spanish newspaper like <span lang=\"TR\"><a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2014/11/15/actualidad/1416076557_740094.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><em>El Pais</em> has bluntly challenged his views</span></a></span> by writing that Erdogan was a leader cut off from reality and recalling his recommendations to the Finnish Prime Minister <span lang=\"TR\">Jyrki Katainen </span>during a visit there on the <span lang=\"TR\"><a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2014/11/15/actualidad/1416076557_740094.html\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">need for Finnish families to have at least three children</span></a></span> as he recommends the Turks.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The <em>Washington Post</em> also challenges Erdogan\'s interpretation of history: \"Most scholars insist the \'mosque\' mentioned was a metaphorical allusion to a striking land feature. There have been no archaeological discoveries of Islamic structures pre-dating Columbus\' arrival in the New World.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Rewriting history according to one\'s own religious beliefs, no matter the new narrative, is a highly controversial and perilous enterprise, particularly when the very politician is already under suspicion for his sectarian policies at home and abroad.

Still, he was lucky to escape the tragic end of Giordano Bruno. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">In \"On the Infinite Universe and Worlds\", Bruno argued that the universe was infinite and that it contained an infinite number of worlds in 1584.

He asserted the universe\'s infinity with hardly any reliable evidence. But there is one favourable thing about Bruno which makes me like him the most: He resisted the authority. He figured out that the stars are distant suns not scientifically but with intuition, but also he sacrificed his life for it. He was like a science knight as he resisted the common belief imposed by the Church which was not only the political authority then but also dominated ordinary people\'s lives.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Precious refusal</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Turkish President Recep Tayyip <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/erdogan-says-muslims-discovered-americas-20141115181222841516.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Erdogan\'s recent words at a summit of Muslim leaders</a> from Latin America generated an altercation full of derision.

The summit in question gathered Latin American <em>Muslim</em> leaders. The context of his argument was appropriate as the attendants were Muslims from the Americas. Erdogan has always been the person who connects history to present-day politics. He talks about ties between Africa and Islam when he visits Africa or the common history of the Turks and Asia when he meets his Asian counterparts. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">When I took a closer look at the controversy spurred by Erdogan\'s speech, I realised that his words were distorted by the headlines. He didn\'t actually say that Muslims discovered America. He said: \"Muslim sailors reached the American continent 314 years before Columbus, in 1178. In his memoirs, Christopher Columbus mentions the existence of a mosque atop a hill on the coast of Cuba.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">As such, Erdogan merely made a mention of Muslims\' arriving to the Americas before Columbus and he didn\'t claim it as a discovery. He also referred to Columbus\' writings and didn\'t make something up.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The discovery of the Americas has always been a controversial issue and Columbus\' claims in his memoirs have been questioned before. For hundreds of years, it was accepted that Columbus discovered the Americas but <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.psmag.com/navigation/books-and-culture/fail-christopher-columbus-america-discovery-bahamas-holiday-68247/\" target=\"_blank\">this theory is no longer reliable</a>. For example, <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.historytoday.com/s-frederick-starr/so-who-did-discover-america\" target=\"_blank\">Islamic scholar Abu Raihan al-Biruni</a> may have discovered the American continent long before Columbus, according to S Frederick Starr. Or Fuat Sezgin, a Turkish professor emeritus on Arabic-Islamic science, has stated for a long time that, it was <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.laits.utexas.edu/gma/mappamundi/docs/precolumbamerica.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">discovered by Muslim seafarers</a>. There are many other claims that <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://lostislamichistory.com/columbus-was-not-the-first-to-cross-the-atlantic/\" target=\"_blank\">Muslims were the first to cross the Atlantic</a> but that\'s not the issue any more as Erdogan\'s words have been distorted, decontextualised and used to discredit him.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Greatest absurdity</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">As Winston Churchill once said, \"History is written by the victors.\" Nevertheless, the most nonsensical side of the discussion on Erdogan\'s remarks is the critics accepting a controversial topic as fact and accusing him of <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/11/turkey-muslim-conquest-america-columbus-erdogan.html\" target=\"_blank\">attempting to rewrite history</a>. Yet the greatest absurdity is to use mockery on social media as evidence of Erdogan\'s being unscientific. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\"Western sources shouldn\'t be believed as if they are sacred texts,\" Erdogan recently said, without taking a step back. Going further, he promised to maintain his encouraging role in this regard. In Turkey, it is known that he is good at trending topics and is a talented politician in driving the common agenda. It looks like he is now showcasing this skill in the international arena.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The West\'s policymakers and opinion shapers are <span>puppeteers in today\'s world</span>; members of the new Inquisition. Of course, their methods don\'t include burning witches or chopping off heretics\' heads but they prefer to discredit their challengers in public, denouncing them as radicals, or worse.

Several residents told Al Jazeera that the ISIL siege was motivated by vengeance as the province \"stood by the Iraqi military and police forces and resisted ISIL domination\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The humanitarian crisis can be illustrated by the price of a bag of flour which, if it can be found at all, costs $100 compared to $20 prior to the siege. \"Prices for food have skyrocketed five-fold following a two-month siege by ISIL,\" said resident Yaqoub Abbasi, noting many in his town now live on a gruel made from spelt.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Pointing to his town\'s air field, Abbasi urged the world community to work with the government in Baghdad to deliver aid to the town\'s inhabitants.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Last month, ISIL announced it had taken more territory in Anbar province, even as Iraq\'s army and pro-government Sunni fighters continued to pursue the armed group. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Iraqi government forces succeeded in recapturing the town of Ameriyah in Fallujah, <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/video/middleeast/2014/10/fighting-rages-iraq-anbar-province-2014105101450991649.html\" target=\"_blank\">a strategic town that links Anbar to Baghdad </a> and the south of the country.

Sabah Karhout, the governor of Anbar province, told Al Jazeera that some areas have indeed been suffering from famine, including the villages locked between Heet (70km west of Anbar\'s provincial capital Ramadi) and Haditha and in Amiriyat al-Fallujah. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The daily provision of water by tankers to the Heet district has been suspended since October 2 because of security concerns.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\"When Heet was captured by ISIL, all of the connecting towns and cities dotted across the province were now shut down, which resulted in the scarce food supplies,\" Karhout said. \"Amiriyat al-Fallujah faces a worse crisis because it is under ISIL siege from all four corners.\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/10/iraq-army-withdraws-from-last-base-hit-20141013105557467561.html\" target=\"_blank\">Up to 180,000 people have been displaced by </a>fighting in and around Heet, the UN said last month. A walled market town 30km from Ramadi, Heet had been home to 100,000 people who had fled other areas of Iraq that fell to ISIL. The town lies close to the Ain al-Asad military base, one of Iraq\'s largest defence facilities.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n<br /> </div>\r\n<p> <span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The people who have it worst, Othman said, are the hospital patients stuck in limbo: Even as the hospitals in Amiriyat al-Fallujah are running low on all medical supplies, these patients are unable to make it to the nearest hospital in Ramadi.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">And while central government forces remain in command of the capital, they have not allowed much-needed trucks of food to cross the Bazeebez Bridge linking Anbar with Baghdad, Karhout noted. ISIL\'s siege has impeded international aid organisations from helping displaced families in the region. The governor stressed that aid must be delivered by air, with the cooperation of Iraqi forces. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\"Anbar province is in dire need of thousands of tonnes of food aid and humanitarian assistance,\" he said, \"and addressing such a need requires the cooperation of the government in Baghdad, the United Nations, the European Union and the Arab League.\"</span></p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/10/13/2014101310918793621_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/Images/2014/10/13/2014101310918793621_20.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-25 20:12:40','Al Jazeera staff',0.00000000,0.00000000,NULL,NULL),(193,'2014112571528256510','http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2014/11/explosions-rattle-afghan-capital-kabul-2014112571528256510.html','Explosions rattle Afghan capital','Roadside bomb in Kabul kills soldier and injures six others, while second blast in centre of city causes no casualties.','<p>Two explosions shook homes in Afghanistan\'s capital, one of which killed a soldier and wounded six others.</p>\r\n<p>Hashmat Stanekzai, the spokesman for Kabul\'s police chief, said a roadside bomb targeted an Afghan National Army minibus early on Tuesday morning, causing the casualties.</p>\r\n<p>The Kabul provincial police chief, General Mohammad Zahir, said the second blast in the centre of the city a few hours later did not cause casualties.</p>\r\n<p>Tuesday’s blast came a day after a magnetic bomb killed two US troops in Kabul.</p>\r\n<p>The capital has seen an escalation in attacks by armed groups in recent months, many targeting foreigners and security installations.</p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/7/8/20147861941779580_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/Images/2014/7/8/20147861941779580_20.jpg',NULL,'Agencies','2014-11-25 19:08:18','Al Jazeera',0.00000000,0.00000000,NULL,NULL),(194,'2014112552418399369','http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/11/michael-brown-racism-america-o-2014112552418399369.html','Michael Brown, racism and America\'s open casket','Justice for African Americans will remain an illusion as long as America fails to account for racism.','<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">\"<span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.bobdylan.com/us/songs/death-emmett-till\" target=\"_blank\">He was a black skin boy.

The lyrics are as timely today as when they were first written and performed because \"black skin\" remains a threat and the cause of death of far too many in the United States and the world. The song relates the story of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old black youngster from Chicago, who was murdered while visiting relatives in Mississippi on August 28, 1955, by two white men because, supposedly, he flirted with a white woman. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Mamie, Emmett\'s mother, insisted on a public funeral in Chicago with an open casket for everyone to view the brutality of racism that completely disfigured and mutilated the face of her beautiful boy.

Once again, the nation and the world are numbed at the no-guilty verdict and the closing of America\'s moral casket on the hopes, dreams and aspirations of Michael Brown, a young African American whose body was riddled with America\'s bullets of racism and indifference to Black suffering.   </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">How to be shocked when we are sick and tired of being shocked, as the deaths of blacks is the daily norm and normalised in the nation\'s consciousness?

Some are quick to point to gains made by African Americans since the civil rights movement; and, indeed we can point to these noticeable advancements including the first black president in the White House. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">However, statistical data provides a different picture of a nation that is separate and profoundly unequal.

Often US politicians and media talking heads spend countless hours speaking on prison-related human rights abuses abroad while under their noses a prison industrial complex is humming efficiently and their 401K might be invested in parts of it and providing a healthy return. More critically, <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.stateofworkingamerica.org/fact-sheets/african-americans/\" target=\"_blank\">African American household net worth stands</a> at $4,995 compared to $97,000 for whites, which is slightly ahead of an adult living under occupation in Palestine, and a poverty rate of 27.4 percent twice the national average.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">In The National Center for Victims of Crime study, a troubling picture for African American young males and crime emerges concluding that \"black youth are three times more likely to be victims of reported child abuse or neglect, <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.victimsofcrime.org/our-programs/other-projects/youth-initiative/interventions-for-black-children\'s-exposure-to-violence/black-children-exposed-to-violence\" target=\"_blank\">three times more likely to be victims of robbery</a>, and five times more likely to be victims of homicide. In fact, homicide is the leading cause of death among African American youth ages 15 to 24\". </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> While the data shows blacks are victims of crime nevertheless, the approach by the government to their community adds insult to injury by treating them collectively as a criminal class by deploying police force to control rather than to serve and provide protection for the trans-historically abused community. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Racism is America\'s open casket to the world and the murder of Michael Brown is the latest episode in a too familiar story dating back to the founding of the country. Emmett Till\'s casket remains open today for the underlying causes that murdered him are still around and unchanged. Michael Brown\'s cause of death is America\'s racism, the police officer was the weapon and the grand jury is the clean up crew.

Its discriminatory character, turning a large Arab Israeli minority into second-class citizens and delisting Arabic as an official language, will only confirm the ongoing discrimination that members of this group have been subjected to well before the drafting of the new law.</p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The fallout from this piece of legislation is likely to be purely symbolic, marking a shift in the Israeli ideology hailed by some right-wing elements of the Netanyahu government as a return to the basics of Zionism.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The schizophrenic self-presentation of the State of Israel as Jewish and democratic is coming to an end in a clear choice of the polity\'s Jewish and non-democratic fibre. But exactly what does a \"Jewish nation-state\" mean?</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The ideologues of the regime are quick to point out that there is no inherent tension between France being a French and democratic state, or Germany being a German and democratic country. But neither Frenchness nor Germanness is equivalent to Jewishness. Even if the majority of citizens in France and Germany are Christian, these states are not declared to be \"Christian nation-states\".</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span lang=\"EN-US\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Definition of Jewishness</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">So what if Jewishness were not identical to Judaism, that is to say, to the Jewish religion? In fact, the official discourse in Israel has been, for a long time and purposefully, blurring the distinctions between religion, nationality, and ethnicity.</span></p>\r\n<p>The very definition of Jewishness according to the <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/mfa-archive/1950-1959/pages/law%20of%20return%205710-1950.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">1950 Law of Return</a> is ambiguous, seeing that the two possible criteria are: having a Jewish mother or converting to Judaism. The first criterion is biological, while the second is religious.</p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Amendment 2, passed in 1970, accentuates the religious component, bestowing the right of immigration on \"a child and a grandchild of a Jew, the spouse of a Jew, the spouse of a child of a Jew and the spouse of a grandchild of a Jew, except for a person who has been a Jew and has voluntarily changed his religion\". In other words, it is not enough to have been born of a Jewish woman in order to be considered a Jew; the act of conversion from Judaism to another faith would be grounds for excluding the convert from this definition. One wonders what happens under the Law of Return to the self-professed atheists born of Jewish mothers.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">It is apparent that non-Jewish citizens of a Jewish state will find themselves in a limbo, regardless of the vacuous guarantees of \"equal personal rights\" under the law awaiting approval. But, as I have mentioned above, their predicament has been dire well before the drafting of this bill. The question, then, is why is the Israeli government dropping the pretence of its ability to balance the state\'s Jewish and democratic nature now, at this precise moment?</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Beyond the politicking considerations of a coalition dominated by right-wing hardliners, there are at least two possible explanations for the timing of the proposed piece of legislation.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span lang=\"EN-US\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Major stumbling blocks</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">First, it attempts to codify a narrative that equates the land occupied by the State of Israel with the \"historic homeland of the Jewish people\". With these words enshrined in the law, yet another obstacle will arise on the path to peace with the Palestinian people, who will be not only materially and symbolically, but also legally dispossessed of their land and their history.</span></p>\r\n<p>The words I have cited from the draft legislation usurp the historic origin as the exclusive property of one group of citizens and turn a deaf ear to the rightful claims of another group. Moreover, they render the Jewish attachment to a distant past more important than the ongoing presence of non-Jewish inhabitants in the same territory. All these are major stumbling blocks in the peace process, which will be guaranteed to stay fruitless if future Israeli governments are bound by the \"Jewish nation-state\" law. For instance, in accordance with it, the right of return for Palestinian refugees will be outright denied on the grounds that the territory claimed by Israel was not <em>their</em> historic homeland.</p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Second, and more cynically: Could it be that the current rulers of Israel have made a calculated, conscious choice to weaken their emphasis on democracy? Although, in order to gain admission into the international community, it is still necessary to present one\'s state as democratic, the time of this requirement\'s non-negotiability might be coming to an end. </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Widespread passive acceptance of technocracy and the dictates of the \"Troika\" in the European Union are the telltale signs of a gradual departure from democratic rhetoric and political practice. It would not be surprising that the Israeli right-wing politicians are ahead of the curve in an avowed abandonment of democratic discourse, and that the draft bill is but a symptom of this lamentable development.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span lang=\"EN-US\"><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.michaelmarder.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Marder</a> is IKERBASQUE Research Professor at the University of the Basque Country, Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain.

His \'Blue Workers\' Cooperative\' aims to help migrant workers find employment, to protect their labour rights, to provide free educational and social activities, and to dig out the workers\' true vocation and hidden talents - to see what else they have got to make a living out of.</p>\r\n<p>He Zhongzhou and eight other volunteers have managed to gather tens of thousands of migrant workers under the cooperative and more join every month. But now the clock is ticking for He to keep funding his cooperative so that he can continue to help the workers and avoid having to shut down the cooperative altogether.</p>\r\n<p>So will He Zhongzhou be able to raise funds to keep the \'Blue Workers\' Cooperative\' going, as it challenges corporations and the Chinese state?</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>By Ying Cui</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea of a \"cooperative\" comes from the West. The industrial Mondragon Cooperative Corporation in Spain and the successful cooperative banks and stores throughout Europe have inspired He Zhongzhou to believe that the exploited and discriminated migrant workers in contemporary China would need to set up cooperatives for themselves.</p>\r\n<p>In May 2011, He Zhongzhou quit his job as an investigative journalist from China\'s most outspoken newspaper, <em>Southern Weekly</em>, and started to pursue his dream: setting up an NGO, Blue Workers\' Cooperative to do something really useful for his migrant worker brothers. This film is about He Zhongzhou and how he struggles to keep his Blue Workers\' Cooperative running.</p>\r\n<p>During the filming, I lived in He\'s cozy and quiet home with his family in Beijing, and experienced noisy and sleepless nights in the industrial area in Shenzhen, where He lives with workers.</p>\r\n<p>He\'s father complained that He had not brought any income to his family in the last three years and He\'s wife was unhappy that he lived 1,500 miles away from home. Helping migrant workers means He is drifting apart from his own family.</p>\r\n<p>I quickly realised that He Zhongzhou\'s \'Blue Workers Cooperative\' has touched many issues that aim to improve migrant workers\' lives: they have set up an organic farm for migrant workers and encouraged them to learn modern farming skills, they have helped migrant workers set up small businesses in their spare time, they have offered free classes on improving health and finances, and they have also helped to educate migrant workers\' children.</p>\r\n<p>However, migrant workers in China have long been unhappy with their pay, inhumane treatment in factories and lack of equal education opportunities for their careers. They are increasingly launching factory strikes and taking to the streets to protest. Migrant worker unrest is a huge issue that could lead to greater unrest, and they have become a politically sensitive topic.</p>\r\n<p>\'Blue Workers\' Cooperative\', which aims to unite these migrant workers has become a potential threat to the authorities. My cameraman, Duhai, and I were luckily enough not to expose ourselves while working. However, we did encounter a local official, accompanied by a \'Guo Bao\' (National security of China) person having lunch with He Zhongzhou. I originally had the idea of secretly filming He meeting the local official, not realising that he was accompanied by the \'Guo Bao\', but fortunately the camera had run out of battery that moment, or we may not have this film.</p>\r\n<p>As a grassroots NGO, \'Blue Workers\' Cooperative\' starts from what the workers need. He Zhongzhou engaged with these long-ignored people by visiting their homes and talking to them. I was surprised to know that the most pressing thing for these workers is not protecting their rights or improving their quality of life, but something else, which will be shown in the film.</p>\r\n<p>I also witnessed many intelligent and wise workers, who will not give up their dreams, such as becoming a lawyer, a writer or an interpreter. The sharp contrast between workers\' talents and passions, and the boring and repetitive factory work would urge us all to think that after a generation of migration in China, barriers to social mobility still remain. He Zhongzhou and his \'Blue Workers\' Cooperative\' are fighting against these. He Zhongzhou insisted that migrant workers must be united, then they can gain equal rights as urban residents, decent jobs and decent lives.</p>\r\n<p>In October 2014, Guo Yushan, the founder of Chinese NGO Transition Institute, who is a friend of He Zhongzhou, and who is also a farmer\'s son, was detained on the criminal charge of provoking trouble. He Zhongzhou knows that he, himself, is considered a troublemaker too by some in government, but he is optimistic about his future, and he said that he has survived many dangerous times, and he would survive the next too.</p>\r\n','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/25/20141125914304580_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/Images/2014/11/25/20141125914304580_20.jpg',NULL,NULL,'2014-11-24 23:03:04','Al Jazeera',0.00000000,0.00000000,NULL,NULL),(214,'201411246182791415','http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/anti-arab-incitement-grips-israel-201411246182791415.html','Anti-Arab incitement grips Israel ','The sharp rise in racially motivated attacks compounds the hardships facing Palestinians in Israel.','<p><STRONG><i> Haifa - </i></STRONG> As racially motivated attacks and growing incitement gripped Israel over the weekend, 23-year-old Waad Ghantous, a Palestinian citizen of Israel, was not surprised at being verbally accosted in this mixed city, home to both Arabs and Jews on Israel\'s northern coast.</p>\r\n<p>\"The racism is always present, but it\'s much worse now than usual,\" Ghantous, a social worker, told Al Jazeera.</p>\r\n<p>Walking beside her mother recently as they ran errands in the city\'s business district, Ghantous said, she wore a red-and-white chequered keffiyeh around her neck. \"An older guy started yelling at me because of the keffiyeh,\" Ghantous said, noting he was \"very angry and aggressive\".</p>\r\n<p>\"He told me to go to Syria with the other Arabs,\" she said. \"I would\'ve just laughed it off, but I was afraid that other people would join him and who knows what could have happened.\"</p>\r\n<p>In the wake of  <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/jerusalem-synagogue-attacked-gunmen-201411185401123578.html\" target=\"_blank\"> an attack on a synagogue </a> in the Jewish Orthodox Har Nof neighbourhood on November 18, that killed five Israelis, Israeli settler violence targeting Palestinians has soared in the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem.  Tensions have also spilled over into Israel, where an estimated <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&_Culture/newpop.html\" target=\"_blank\"> 1.7 million Palestinians hold Israeli citizenship.  </a></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/analysis-transfer-israeli-arabs-201411135141968716.html\" target=\"_blank\"> <span style=\"font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 16px;\"> RELATED: Analysis: The transfer of Israeli Arabs </span> </a></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>The latest attack took place on Monday, when a <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/israel-police-palestinian-youth-attacked-jews-063614748.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Palestinian youth was attacked by three Israelis </a> in Jerusalem.

But I think people will agree with my decision with time when we try to bring change.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><STRONG><i>Al Jazeera:</i></STRONG> <STRONG><i>Which are Modi\'s policies that impressed you?</i></STRONG> </span></p>\r\n<p><span><STRONG><i>Bhat:</i></STRONG> He was the first prime minister who answered the question of how will you handle the Jammu and Kashmir issue. And he said it would be with <em>jamuriyat, insaniyat, kashmiriyat</em> that is secularism, humanity, and <em>kashmiriyat</em> [the ethno-national and social consciousness and cultural values of the Kashmiri people]. He wants peace and he wants development in the state. If he is saying and doing it in other parts of the country then why not Kashmir? Why should a Kashmiri always complain and sulk? Why should a Kashmiri always die? Why should a Kashmiri mother lose kids and cry with pain? Why does a Kashmiri have a degree and no job? We have nothing in Kashmir. It is a green dead space. I want to rebuild Kashmir with BJP. </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span><STRONG><i>Al Jazeera:</i></STRONG> <STRONG><i>BJP is associated with a Hindutva agenda. Does that bother you as a Muslim Kashmiri woman?</i></STRONG> </span></p>\r\n<p><span><STRONG><i>Bhat:</i></STRONG> We Kashmiris are very broadminded people. I would simply say that NC had an alliance with Congress, which is not a Muslim party. We should be happy and proud of BJP. At least, they are following their religion with dedication. There is nothing wrong with being a Hindu. Nobody is taking your rights as a Muslim. Nobody is forcing you to leave your religion. People in India follow different religions. So this Hindutva and anti-Muslim talk is from other political parties. I don\'t believe in that and the majority of Kashmiris don\'t believe in that. It is just a few fanatical people around. The majority of people want change. So if Modi\'s vision towards Kashmir is sincere, then everybody should vote [for us]. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><STRONG><i>Al Jazeera:</i></STRONG> <STRONG><i>BJP has a set a goal of winning more than 44 seats in Jammu and Kashmir. Why do you think BJP will gain ground in the largely Muslim electorate of Kashmir?</i></STRONG></span></p>\r\n<p><span><STRONG><i>Bhat:</i></STRONG> We are fed up with the present government. We are fed up with leaders and their fake promises and their high level corruption. Not even a leaf moves without corruption in Kashmir. Everybody wants change, everybody wants peace and everybody wants rehabilitation. If they could not give relief without nepotism to flood-hit victims, then how will they form a government again? Before, the choice other than National Conference used to be PDP. They have tasted the NC, PDP, Congress, now they can try change with BJP.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Al Jazeera: The BJP government has been criticised for being tightfisted about the relief package - 745 crore rupees ($120m) - for the floods, which the prime minister announced in October.</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span><STRONG><i>Bhat:</i></STRONG> The first day of the flood, when the prime minister came, he gave 100 crore rupees ($16m). Then the transport minister came and he gave some funds. Then, we got the tourism minster, then we got the health minister, then we got the power minister. We got ministers from all the departments. If we put it together and distribute it, I think no one should be complaining. But there is so much corruption and mismanagement that the funds are not being utilised [effectively]. Leave behind corruption, nepotism, and discrimination and everyone would get their [fair] share. </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Al Jazeera: Do Kashmiris want independence?</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span><STRONG><i>Bhat:</i></STRONG> We want autonomy. Today, I met a boy while I was campaigning door-to-door. He asked if I was going to touch 370 [an article in the Indian constitution which grants special autonomous status to Jammu and Kashmir]. I said no. He said if you remove AFSPA [1958 Armed Forces Special Powers Act which grants special powers to the Indian army in terms of law enforcement] then I\'m with you. I said that if they touch </span>370 then I will quit BJP and AFSPA is for our own safety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>He said that [AFSPA] is not for our safety and asked who would rebuild houses if there are no people left. I was looking at this very young boy. I still said that [AFSPA] is for our safety because anyone can come up and attack us. Pakistan is just waiting to occupy [Kashmir], India is not ready to leave because of its own political issues, and in between a Kashmiri is dying. No doubt, because of the forces here, lots have been killed. There has been human rights violations. Lots of women have been raped. Lots of youth killed. </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Al Jazeera: </i></STRONG><STRONG><i>Doesn\'t that make your task even harder - fighting an election and standing as a candidate for the BJP?</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Bhat: </i></STRONG>No. We were part of India, we are part of India and we cannot forget that. Don\'t ever forget that we are the crown of India but we wanted a separate territory with our own laws, our own everything. But it is not happening, we have got nothing out of this jihad till now except that we have lost our kids, husbands, and brothers. We have just been at a loss. We want to live a normal life, to live in a democracy, elections should happen otherwise anyone can come and take advantage of us. The issue of autonomy will go forward with talks, not with guns. It will not go without contesting elections. It has to move forward with peace. </p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i>Follow Betwa Sharma on Twitter: <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://twitter.com/betwasharma\" target=\"_blank\">@betwasharma</a></i></STRONG></em></p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/24//201411247327577734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/24//201411247327577734_2.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-24 22:42:55','Betwa Sharma',34.08365810,74.79736810,NULL,NULL),(216,'201411248297500401','http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/11/indonesia-ambitious-social-reforms-launched-201411248297500401.html','Indonesia\'s ambitious social reforms launched','New social security programmes targeting tens-of-millions of the country\'s poorest are the largest in the world.','<div><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"><STRONG><i>Jakarta, Indonesia </i></STRONG>-<STRONG><i> </i></STRONG></span><span lang=\"en-US\">Imas isn\'t too sure when she was born, but she thinks she\'s about 35.

The new cards - which in their first phase are designed to target the poorest 15.5 million Indonesians, including \"homeless and internally displaced people\" - are part of what the World Bank described as the \"<a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/indonesia/brief/reducing-extreme-poverty-in-indonesia\" target=\"_blank\">largest social security reform effort in the world today</a>\".</span></div>\r\n<div><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"> </span></span></div>\r\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">On face value, the scheme is merely a rebranding of existing programmes set up under the previous administration, including Indonesia\'s national </span><span lang=\"en-US\"><em>BPJS Kesehatan</em></span><span lang=\"en-US\"> - the world\'s largest \"single payer\" health scheme - that was set up in January.</span></span></div>\r\n<div><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"> </span></span></div>\r\n<div><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">But there\'s a crucial difference.

This effort did not merely do away with classic birthright citizenship moving forward: This overzealous xenophobic effort stripped birthright citizenship for all those born in the country since the 1920s. Sadly, this event by our Caribbean neighbour went unnoticed in the United States.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Though a country\'s effort to create a stateless group is universally condemned, rogue countries have sadly used such a tactic to harm its most vulnerable minority groups.

In other words, they exist as the most invisible and deprived people on the planet. </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Ending statelessness</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The global effort to end statelessness is widely applauded, especially by western democracies. Yet, it has <span>just</span> occurred to our southern border, and the leader of the free world has thus far remained silent. Specifically, on September 23, 2013, the Dominican Republic\'s Constitutional Court stripped the citizenship of hundreds of thousands of its residents in violation of that country\'s own constitution. This outrageous ruling occurred despite the fact that the very language of the governing constitution specifically recognises those individuals as citizens.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">In response, on October 9, 2013, the Centre for Analysis and Research in Human Rights commenced a petition to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), where the Dominican Republic is a member state. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Perhaps knowing that it did not have any legitimate defences, on November 4, the Constitutional Court, despite no longer having any related cases before it, on its own motion and without any parties formally calling for any decision related to the matter, wrote an unfounded advisory opinion that could only be viewed as a mockery of justice. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The court ruled that despite the Dominican Republic\'s signing onto the IACHR treaty and being under the jurisdiction of the IACHR since the 1970s, the country was not bound by any determination of the IACHR. The world community immediately condemned this act.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Yet, the matter makes hardly a headline in the US.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">If we believe that human rights matter, if international laws mean anything at all, we must condemn this abuse of basic human rights. This travesty at our doorstep simply cannot be tolerated. We must not allow history to repeat itself. Indeed, the actions in the Dominican Republic should remind us of the most horrific events in world history. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Citizenship deprivation</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Before the atrocities associated with the Holocaust happened, the Third Reich\'s Law on the Revocation of Naturalisations and the Deprivation of German Citizenship (July 14, 1933) deprived German Jews of their German citizenship. The law directed the collection and publication of the names of Jews, the names were listed in the Reich Law Gazette (\"Reichsgesetzblatt\"), and with the publication of the particular Reichsgesetzblatt, Jews lost their German citizenship. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Tragically, after the Dominican high court\'s decision, Dominican agencies were similarly directed to collect the names of Dominicans of Haitian lineage. While it is hopefully unlikely that the genocide of past generations will be repeated, the fact remains that hundreds of thousands of Dominicans are stateless, without any rights, and are subject to persecution that has already commenced. </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">In a similar set of circumstances, the world community has recently condemned Myanmar\'s persecution of their Rohingya Muslim minority. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Much like what is happening just to our south, a 1982 law revoked the citizenship of the Rohingya, which has led to atrocities that the United Nations and numerous other human rights organisations have condemned. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Much like what we are sure to hear from the Dominican Republic, after stripping people of citizenship, both the Third Reich and Myanmar characterised their persecuted people as mere illegal immigrants worthy of no rights.

Such distortions are simply perverse and without basis in reality, or law for that matter. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Decency and morals should cause us to rise up and insist that our government and our business interests act to end this atrocity, which otherwise may end with hundreds of thousands of refugees rushing to our shores and others throughout the hemisphere.

That ISIL killed a Muslim convert is not extraordinary, but rather part of a routine practise of beheading Muslims that has emerged over the last decade.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Second, Kassig\'s death fits into an ongoing media narrative which explains ISIL\'s televised beheadings, usually carried out by European Muslims, as a means to attract new recruits, particularly from the West. Televised beheadings, which have been explained away as a means of intimidation of enemies and a marketing tool to gather new recruits, has a much more complex history and rationale.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Routinised campaign</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Beheadings in the name of Islam conducted by non-state actors can be <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2000/aug/05/news/mn-65169\" target=\"_blank\">traced to the war in <span class=\"InternalLink\">Chechnya</span></a>, with the decapitations of captured Russian soldiers.

However, the first systematic, routinised campaign of beheadings of both Muslims and non-Muslims began after the 2003 Iraq war, by a group that was initially separate from al-Qaeda. </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The Jordanian, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was the founder of the group during the Iraqi insurgency that would evolve into ISIL, and their most notorious beheading was of the American Nick Berg in 2004, dressing him in an orange jump suit to mimic the prisoners of Guantanamo Bay. His death occurred however, within a broader campaign whose victims were primarily Muslims, whether it was captured Iraqi soldiers or Turkish truck drivers in Iraq, such as Ramazan Elbu. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Once Zarqawi\'s group decided to merge with al-Qaeda, becoming al-Qaeda in Iraq, al-Qaeda\'s central leadership pressured Zarqawi to end the beheadings, which often targeted Muslims, and refocus their attention on attacking US forces, representing the first tension between the two groups before their formal break in 2013. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">During these years, Zarqawi\'s group did not have the pretensions of statehood. It was a non-state actor that used beheadings as a way of forcing nations deploying troops to Iraq, such as the Philippines, to withdraw; prevent private companies from investing in Iraq\'s reconstruction; and intimidate Iraqis from joining the armed forces. To achieve the last two goals it primarily targeted Muslims participating in these endeavours. </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Progenitor of ISIL beheadings</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">ISIL still uses beheadings, but for different aims. When the progenitor of ISIL conducted beheadings after the Iraq War, it was ostensibly to force foreign armies off Iraqi soil. By 2014, not only had all foreign armies left Iraq, but ISIL controlled a large swath of territory. Beheadings in 2014 of captured US and British hostages served as a means of a weak state, the \"Islamic State\", to retaliate against the US and UK air campaign against ISIL.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">ISIL is aware that western media outlets will not show the actual video of the moment of beheading, nevertheless the act of beheading does generate a storm of debate in the media. The gruesome method of beheading, as opposed to the firing squads they used to kill a large number of captured Iraqi soldiers, allows ISIL to cause revulsion among political leaders. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">With an act of a sword, they manage to force both Obama and Cameron to react. The two men, who control the world\'s most advanced militaries, find themselves at the mercy of the sword. Both displayed physical pain and grief when they condemned the way their nationals died. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">One media narrative examines <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/10/beheadings-as-terror-marketing/381049/\" target=\"_blank\">beheadings as \"Terror Marketing\"</a>, suggesting that ISIL\'s rationale behind these videos is to <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://wwlp.com/2014/09/04/isis-hopes-to-gain-support-with-its-beheading-videos/\" target=\"_blank\">attract new recruits</a>. An example of the \"terror marketing\" rationale can be found in the following statement by Paul Cruickshank, a terrorism analyst for CNN: \"Some of these men almost have a <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/10/beheadings-as-terror-marketing/381049/\" target=\"_blank\">pornographic attraction to these violent scenes</a>, these violent beheading videos. It really sort of energises them.\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Since the beheading campaign began in 2004 in Iraq, there have been a host of \"snuff\" websites, such as Ogrish.com and Liveleak, which upload beheading videos, demonstrating that \"pornographic attraction\" exists in the general public, though there has not been a wave of Ogrish or Liveleak viewers joining ISIL. One cannot possibly know if these videos \"energise\" an ISIL recruit as Cruickshank suggests. Most likely a beheading video will have little effect on the alienation a potential ISIL recruit perceives in his or her home society and is most likely energised by ISIL\'s actual success in establishing the \"Islamic State\", rather than these videos. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Furthermore, does ISIL\'s leadership even see these videos as a valuable recruiting tool? Mexican <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/06/22/96335_mexican-cartel-deals-drugs-violence.html?rh=1\" target=\"_blank\">drug cartels also conduct beheadings</a> in areas they control. For both organisations, beheadings serve as a means of maintaining domestic hegemony. It forces the population under their control to cower in fear and never challenge the power of the cartel, one of which happens to survive by charging for drugs, while the other charges for oil. </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Vengeance justice</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">On another level, ISIL contends to have formed an \"Islamic State\", and beheadings serve the same purpose as capital punishment in any state. They communicate both vengeance justice to its citizens, and at the same time instil fear into those citizens, which even include the most diehard ISIL foot soldier. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Beheadings are ISIL\'s public executions, just as the guillotine, hanging, or lethal injection, either in the town square or on TV, demonstrate the price of violating what the state deems as law and order. They serve as an internal policing mechanism, communicating to every member of ISIL the punishment for any \"acts of treason\", or couched in ISIL\'s terms, \"apostasy\". </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">ISIL\'s execution of Kassig, a Muslim convert, was part of a decade-long process within a Muslim civil war, centred on an Islamic State, but with ramifications beyond its borders. Kassig\'s execution is indicative of a re-articulation of identity within the western world. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Kassig was an <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/20/world/europe/second-frenchman-is-identified-in-isis-video-of-peter-kassig.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">American convert apparently killed by two French converts</a>. In a tragic irony, Kassig shared something in common with his kidnappers. All three probably left their homes in the US and France respectively to seek out a cause greater than their lives and identities in their western settings. Seeking that cause brought them to the tragic episode that unfolded last week.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Finally, the focus on the religion of the victim, hides something more tragic about Kassig\'s death. He was simply a human being volunteering as an aid worker to help a lot of Muslims and Christians displaced by the conflict in Syria. The focus on Kassig\'s conversion was irrelevant. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Similar questions were raised about whether David Haines and Alan Henning might have <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-29668473\" target=\"_blank\">converted to Islam before their deaths</a>. These two British aid workers in Syria, beheaded by ISIL, were simply humans who left their comfortable existence in the UK to help other humans dispossessed in Syria. Despite their deaths, the families of all three beheading victims publicly stated that people should not blame Islam for their loss. Both the victims and their families showed compassion and forgiveness in their lifetime. These three men and their families were more Muslim than many Muslims in this world today. </span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Ibrahim al-Marashi is an assistant professor at the Department of History, California State University, San Marcos.

It begins in 1992, when the Tanzanian government licensed Ortelo Business Corporation (OBC) - owned by a senior official of the United Arab Emirates government - to organise hunting expeditions in Loliondo, a 4,000sq km stretch of land on the edge of the Serengeti National Park in northern Tanzania, near the border with Kenya. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The expanse, designated a \"Game Controlled Area\" (the formal designation for territory earmarked for licensed hunting) in 1959, when the country was still under colonial rule, teems with antelopes, lions, leopards, cheetah, wildebeest, and other wildlife. But it has also been, for centuries, home to tens of thousands of people from the pastoral Maasai ethnic group, and grazing ground for their herds. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">For close to two decades the Maasai and the foreign trophy-hunters managed to coexist, albeit uneasily. Until 2009, when the Tanzanian government introduced a new law completely outlawing farming and herding in a 1,500sq km stretch of the Game Controlled Area. On the back of that law the police swooped in, assaulting residents and demolishing hundreds of homesteads. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Following protests, including an online petition - <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://avaaz.org/en/save_the_maasai/?slideshow\" target=\"_blank\">\"Stop the Serengeti Sell-off\"</a>, which attracted international attention and now has more than 1.8 million signatures - respite appeared to come the way of the beleaguered communities. In 2013, activist groups claimed the government had backed off.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Renewed government threats</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Now, a year on, the trenches are being re-dug.

In what is perhaps a sign that the government is determined to go ahead with the eviction, it is reportedly offering the affected communities about $500,000 in compensation. </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Were he alive, Julius Nyerere, who led Tanganyika (as Tanzania was then known) to independence in the 1960s, would not be surprised. In his essay, <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.nathanielturner.com/ujamaanyerere.htm\" target=\"_blank\">\"Ujamaa: The Basis of African Socialism\"</a>, first published in 1962, he wrote: \"In a country such as this, where, generally speaking, the African are poor and the foreigners are rich, it is quite possible that, within 80 or 100 years, if the poor African were allowed to sell his land, all the land in Tanganyika would belong to wealthy immigrants, and the local people would be tenants.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Nyerere, equating capitalism with exploitation, and seeking to entrench an African version of socialism in Tanzania, vowed that land in the country would never be privately owned. (Admittedly, the success of that ideological experiment is debatable.)</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">As things have turned out in this Tanzanian case, it\'s not poor African peasants letting go of their land, but their government taking those liberties on their behalf. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">There are those who insist this is part of a larger trend across Africa, in which wealthy individuals and large companies acquire large tracts of land (and sometimes water) from cash-strapped governments in developing countries. Critics sum it up as \"<a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9xmvedqHkZsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=the+land+grabbers&hl=en&sa=X&ei=uJ1dUfDAFOX80QX2z4HoBg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=the%20land%20grabbers&f=false\" target=\"_blank\">land-grabbing</a>\"; Sudan, Malawi, and Ghana are three of the countries that have gone down that route in recent years. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The question that arises is a simple one: Who is looking out for the ordinary people, the ones at the bottom of the ladder, for whom the land at stake is the difference between hunger and a filled stomach; between despondency and a modicum of dignity? Who can we count on to ensure that they are not condemned to getting the short end of the natural resource stick; the way it has happened with oil and diamonds and copper and cocoa all these decades?</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">We can almost always be certain it won\'t be the government, sadly. In the <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.transparency.org/cpi2013/results\" target=\"_blank\">2013 Corruption Perceptions Index</a>, which measures the extent to which the citizens of a country perceive that country\'s public service to be corrupt, African countries generally belonged in the bottom.

The deals were signed in spite of the objections of the Liberian parliament. Firestone is today the largest private employer of labour in the country. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">So, what is the way out? There will be no easy solutions. Xenophobia will always be a tempting, but ill-advised response to news of \"foreigners\" exploiting \"locals\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Land reform is fundamental. There has to be a way to empower communities to have a say in the use and allocation of their land. Last year, the Malawian Parliament passed a new law that <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.africareview.com/Business---Finance/New-Malawi-law-bars-foreigners-from-owning-land/-/979184/1871112/-/2iy8rw/-/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">makes it harder for chiefs to abuse their powers</a> regarding the sale of communal land. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Across the continent, new laws are needed to bridle corporate ambitions and entrench greater transparency in natural resource deals. In many cases, the laws already exist, but are not being implemented.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Judicial and legislative institutions, which exist to checkmate the executive powers of governments, need to be strengthened; as does civil society, which is best placed to leverage information technology to amplify local grievances - as we have seen with the Maasai online petition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The goal would be to ensure that communities are not kept in the dark regarding negotiations that affect their fortunes; and that, even in the face of collusion between corrupt government officials and big business interests, they do not feel helpless. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Already the Maasai are vowing they would rather die than be evicted from their ancestral land.

He argued that the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) was using Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp as coordination networks, or propaganda mediums. He accused Silicon Valley of being \"in denial about its misuse\". He asked for more cooperation, alleging these companies were resistant.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> Problem of propaganda</span></i></STRONG><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> The nub of Hannigan\'s rhetoric is that GCHQ would rather ISIL use communication mediums which do not have cooperative offices in the West; servers which are readily accessible to his spooks. He casually over-states the problem of propaganda - warning that ISIL generates 40,000 tweets per day, neglecting to mention <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://m.computing.co.uk/ctg/opinion/2379739/was-gchqs-robert-hannigan-right-or-wrong-to-call-on-tech-firms-to-help-with-terrorism-threat\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter hosts half a billion tweets</a> in that same period.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Instead, Hannigan would prefer ISIL communicate in other ways - methods which would be completely opaque to his agency\'s surveillance. Perhaps a paper letter, in a country where there are precious few western intelligence agents. Or a carrier pigeon.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Aside from the bizarre complaint of how damn easy it is to track these people, Hannigan had another gripe - that Silicon Valley does not do enough to help the intelligence agencies track down the bad guys.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The reality could not be more different.</span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> As broad background, we now know that more traditional technology firms like Vodafone, British Telecom, and Verizon already <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/02/telecoms-bt-vodafone-cables-gchq\" target=\"_blank\">gave GCHQ access to the fibre optic cables running a great proportion of the internet</a> under the Atlantic Ocean - equivalent to recording \"all the information in all the books in the British Library 192 times every 24 hours\". GCHQ can also access any information the NSA bulk-collects from Silicon Valley, without even getting a warrant.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">As publicly listed companies, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and WhatsApp have little interest in being \"command and control centres\" for terrorists, or hosting horrific content. Nothing hurts dividends like a website becoming a trove of extremist filth. Thanks to Snowden, awareness of privacy issues is also at an all-time high, and as<a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-29894104\" target=\"_blank\"> tech blog The Register put it </a>\"sales of devices and cloud services would plummet should word get out that US tech giants were willing partners in mass surveillance\". </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Encryption measures</span></i></STRONG><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> Indeed, the Snowden revelations have seen Silicon tech giants implement a range of end-to-end encryption measures to reassure their users that their most intimate details aren\'t being exposed wholesale to spies for no reason. Hannigan\'s piece in the <em>Financial Times </em>is a transparently tactical public relations response to this activity.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">But even despite these market risks, evidence suggests that Silicon Valley is collaborating with surveillance agencies anyway - putting Hannigan\'s view at risk of being painted as pure fantasy.</span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> Twitter, for example, removed a record amount of content from January to June 2014, as made clear in their own <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"https://transparency.twitter.com/removal-requests/2014/jan-jun\" target=\"_blank\">\"transparency reports\"</a>. Other tech companies run similar programmes. Twitter even removed numerous accounts which didn\'t correspond to government requests - meaning they proactively went out and found tweeting terrorists, and expelled them.</span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> As Privacy International also rightly calls out - there are numerous \"official and voluntary<a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.cityam.com/1415131599/gchq-chief-robert-hannigan-right-tech-firms-should-do-more-help-fight-terrorism\" target=\"_blank\"> </a><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.cityam.com/1415131599/gchq-chief-robert-hannigan-right-tech-firms-should-do-more-help-fight-terrorism\" target=\"_blank\">schemes in place\" to allow spooks to access data</a> when needed. The latest documents released by The Intercept suggest that certain, unnamed, US companies knew about the surveillance programmes. Further evidence suggests financial payments were made to Silicon Valley to cover the costs of meeting NSA surveillance requirements. </span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> It may be an attempt to offload blame, but according to NSA\'s top lawyer - Rajesh De, \"big tech companies . provided <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/19/us-tech-giants-knew-nsa-data-collection-rajesh-de\" target=\"_blank\">\'full assistance\'</a> in legally mandated collection of data\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">And as Al Jazeera America recently reported, Google CEO <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/5/6/nsa-chief-google.html\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Schmidt wrote an email </a>to the head of the NSA, apologising for not attending a collaboration meeting - \"General Keith ... so great to see you ... I\'m unlikely to be in California that week so I\'m sorry I can\'t attend [will be on the East Coast]. Would love to see you another time. Thank you!\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The tone doesn\'t suggest an uncooperative relationship.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Ritual lawbreaking </span></i></STRONG><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> Hannigan\'s blaming of Silicon Valley is a crude attempt to launder his agency\'s reputation for ritual lawbreaking since 2001. He has taken the opportunity of the ISIL crisis haunting public opinion, to cancel out the Snowden revelations and his agency\'s mass wrongdoing. His comments came shortly after FBI Director <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://mashable.com/2014/11/03/fbi-director-tech-companies-have-to-be-able-to-unlock-device-for-cops/\" target=\"_blank\">James Comey made near identical comments</a> in the US, calling, like Hannigan did, for more collaboration from tech companies. </span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> Writing in the Financial Times, which has an older audience less-versed with Generation Y\'s obsession with social media, it\'s easy for GCHQ to paint a picture of newfangled technology being evil, rather than ISIL themselves, or indeed GCHQ or the NSA (in relative terms).</span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> There are three words that the unrepentant GCHQ and NSA would do well to remember - before moaning about uncooperative technology companies: <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.investigativeproject.org/documents/case_docs/2482.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Get a warrant</a>. There is already a perfectly decent system for recovering information from any organisation that provides information conduits for a terrorist, regardless of how cooperative the company may be in the meantime. In many ways, we are extremely lucky that ISIL chooses to use the services of western companies to communicate and propagandise.</span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> So Hannigan doesn\'t need to qualitatively criticise the relationship between spying agencies and those companies - the law, a judge, and a warrant can give you all you need.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Alastair Sloan is a London-based journalist.

Hundreds of doctors and health practitioners have been killed or have fled to neighbouring countries, drug supply routes have been destroyed, and government forces have routinely and indiscriminately targeted hospitals.</p>\r\n<p>As a result - and on top of unsanitary living conditions and a sharp drop in overall vaccination coverage - there have been outbreaks of communicable diseases such as hepatitis, leishmaniasis, polio, and tuberculosis.</p>\r\n<p>Polio, eliminated in Syria in 1995, re-emerged last year and spread across large swaths of the country\'s opposition-held north.The highly contagious disease also re-emerged in Iraq this year for the first time since 2000, infecting a baby boy and a young girl. The World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNICEF responded by launching a mass polio vaccination campaign across the region, but health workers say the response was too slow.</p>\r\n<p>\"The first cases of flaccid paralysis were diagnosed clinically in July of 2013, and they weren\'t confirmed by WHO until October,\" Zaher Sahloul, president of the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), told Al Jazeera. \"The WHO initially underestimated the risk and took the Syrian line.\"</p>\r\n<p>Despite the odds, a hugely successful polio campaign has been ongoing in Syria - largely thanks to the Polio Task Force, a coalition of Syrian groups including SAMS, the opposition-linked Assistance and Coordination Unit (ACU) and about half a dozen other groups supported by the Turkish Ministry of Health. Some 8,200 volunteers, including a network of activists and doctors, have completed seven rounds of vaccinations, inoculating about 1.4 million of the estimated 1.5 million children in the area it covers.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/11/polio-syria-putting-children-above-politics-2013111745158504393.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 16px;\">OPINION: Polio in Syria: putting children above politics</span></a></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>But those delivering the vaccinations have faced insurmountable challenges amid the country\'s plummeting security situation, including the deaths of more than four volunteers. </p>\r\n<p>\"[The volunteers] have faced shelling, explosive barrel bombs and were subjected to sniper fire while working,\" Bashir Taj al-Din, a technical coordinator with the ACU, told Al Jazeera. <br /> <br />Doctors running the campaign said they also had to work against rumours that vaccination could cause side effects such as AIDS and impotence, thwarting their efforts to vaccinate as many children as possible against diseases like polio, measles and rubella.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Salah Haithami, the regional Middle East outbreak coordinator at WHO, told Al Jazeera that in its October assessment of Syria\'s polio vaccination campaign, parents\' reluctance to have their children vaccinated had increased. \"We found out that some people had spread rumours on social media that the vaccine is toxic,\" Haithami said, attributing the rumours to an unnamed \"enemy country\".</p>\r\n<p>Healthcare workers have tried to mitigate the problem by vaccinating children in front of their parents to assure them it was safe, Haithami said.</p>\r\n<p>\"I think part of the issue was that the rumours were related to the measles vaccine incident. It definitely played a role in making some families afraid,\" he added, referring to an incident in September in which 15 children died 10 minutes after receiving a measles vaccination in Syria\'s northeastern Idlib province. The UN-sponsored vaccine, administered to 75 children, had been accidentally mixed with atracurium, a muscle relaxant commonly used in surgery. The packaging for atracurium is similar to that of the regular diluent used with the vaccine, and both had been kept in the same refrigerator, explained Khaled Almilaji, the health department manager at the ACU.</p>\r\n<p>Some health experts believe that the error, which resulted in a suspension of the measles vaccination campaign in Idlib and Deir ez-Zor provinces, will have serious ramifications for future vaccination efforts. The incident gravely affected the level of trust between aid providers and civilians, said policy consultant and public health expert Adam Coutts.</p>\r\n<p>\"The case reflects how bad the situation is on the ground, with a lack of staff with adequate medical training and knowledge,\" Coutts told Al Jazeera. \"It will make it even more difficult to convince parents to bring their children to centres to be immunised for all diseases, which provides the conditions for diseases to increase and spread.\"</p>\r\n<p>Haithami urged those who were part of the measles vaccination campaign in Syria to resume inoculating children as soon as possible: \"It\'s a tragedy to lose 15 children but if we stop vaccines, we may lose hundreds.

A US training site and air base is being developed at Bashur airfield, near the KRG town of Harir. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Larger US effort</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The Kurds want a far larger US effort to train over a dozen Peshmerga brigades and they have a good story to tell US legislators.

In contrast, the US built 109 brigades in federal Iraq at a cost of more than $25bn.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The average<a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/last-man-standing-u.s.-security-cooperation-and-kurdistans-peshmerga\" target=\"_blank\"> amount invested in each KRG brigade</a> was $11.5m, compared to $229.3m spent on each federal Iraqi brigade. Today, the eight US-assisted Kurdish units are intact, whereas almost a quarter of the federal forces have disintegrated. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Opponents of the KRG\'s drive for a direct security relationship with the US will instead argue that bypassing Baghdad could hasten the disintegration of Iraq, for instance setting a precedent for the Sunni areas within Iraq to receive arms and training directly from neighbouring states. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The US government will also be hesitant to undermine the new Minister of Defence Khalid al-Ubeidi, a Sunni Arab from Mosul, who visited the KRG Ministry of Peshmerga on November 3 to discuss mutual cooperation. Thus far, Ubeidi has been supportive of both the US plan to train Peshmerga brigades and Germany’s commitment of sufficient equipment to outfit two entire Peshmerga brigades, much of which has already arrived in Erbil unhindered by Baghdad. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The Kurds may seek to overcome US objections by offering their cooperation on critical issues. Future advances by the Peshmerga to close the ring around Mosul or shut off terrorist movements along the Syria-Iraq border may be contingent on boosted provision of US equipment and training. The Kurds are also needed to provide training bases for two new federal government brigades being raised in KRG-controlled areas from the survivors of the destroyed Iraqi army and police units. </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Road to de facto autonomy</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Leveraging these advantages, Erbil could achieve a more direct security relationship with the US and other western partner nations, representing another milestone on the road towards de facto autonomy.

The KRG is readying debt financing legislation that will support its energetic efforts to take out sovereign loans from international banks using oil revenues as collateral. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">This is statehood by another name, which may be viewed by Iraq\'s Kurds as good enough for the time being.

And, Tunisian media\'s obsession with terrorism.','<p>The civil war in Syria has proven to be one of the most difficult and deadliest conflicts in the world for journalists to cover. So when a video - allegedly showing a Syrian boy rescuing a little girl while under gunfire - turned out to be a hoax, there was a vociferous backlash against the Norwegian filmmakers who produced it.</p>\r\n<p>Journalists were at the forefront of the condemnation, accusing the filmmakers of belittling the work of professionals who risk their lives trying to report the truth and suffering of the real victims in the country. Adding to the confusion is the increasingly bizarre propaganda campaign by the armed group known as ISIL where kidnapped journalists are being forced to report for their captors.</p>\r\n<p>Talking us through the Syria story this week are: Lina Khatib, director of Carnegie Middle Eastern Institute; Donatella Della Ratta, PhD fellow at Copenhagen University; Nevine Mabro, foreign editor, <em>Channel 4</em> News; Sherif Mansour, MENA program coordinator at the Committee to Protect Journalists; and Scott Edwards, project manager for the Science for Human Rights project at Amnesty International.</p>\r\n<p>Other media stories on our<em> radar</em> this week: The Russian presidential library announced that it will create an online resource to rival the perceived bias on the open-source encyclopaedia, Wikipedia; Thai TV host Nattaya Wawweerakup has been forced off the air by the ruling military junta for interviewing Thais critical of the new government; publishing giant Conde Nast has agreed to pay $5.8m to more than 7,000 former interns who sued the company, accusing it of denying them minimum wage.</p>\r\n<p>This week\'s feature: Under the regime of former Tunisian President Ben Ali, journalists were told how, what and when to report on issues of national security. Today, with the country\'s new-found media freedom, that is no longer the case but analysts say that the amount of coverage dedicated to national security issues – headlined terrorism - has become disproportionate. Are Tunisians really in the kind of danger that their media suggest or are news outlets just trying to sell papers and drive up ratings in the new commercially driven market? <em>The Listening Post</em>\'s Nic Muirhead reports from Tunis.</p>\r\n<p>Our closing video this week: It turns out that it is not all work on the International Space Station although some technical language can make it appear that way.

Much of the brouhaha has, perhaps predictably, focused on the supposed tension between women\'s rights and a societally prescribed morality. Much less has been said of how it illustrates a residual fear among some Kenyans of the consequences of respecting individual liberties.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Let\'s get the obvious out of the way. The shouting matches on Twitter and elsewhere about women\'s dress choice are really about the rights of individuals, and especially women, to make their own choices and live by their own standards. They are also about the power of any group within a society to decide what is decent and thus what is allowable - to police not just dress, but choice and thought and speech.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">They are part of a wider assault on rights and choices that is perhaps a backlash against the gains achieved in the last three decades. In 2010, the country enacted what was at the time hailed as a progressive constitution, one that codified many of the demands for political and individual freedoms into a bill of rights. However, implementation of the document has proven to be much harder than anticipated. Kenya\'s entrenched political elite has attempted to hollow out and subvert the reform agenda in a bid to retain many of the privileges that they formerly enjoyed.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Arbitrary and coercive powers</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Instead of adopting and implementing new laws to bring the country in line with the constitution, the political elite are engaged in an effort to restore the arbitrary and coercive powers of the extractive state. In doing this, they have suckered many Kenyans into believing that it is civil and political liberties that are the problem, not the refusal to implement the law.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Thus many seem to see individual rights and choices as a harbinger of chaos or to equate order with a restriction of such. Over and over, we are told that \"<a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://mobile.nation.co.ke/blogs/Standard-Gauge-Railway-Project-Infrastructure/-/1949942/2463088/-/format/xhtml/-/faspwb/-/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">the constitutional reform process has left people with an exaggerated sense of rights</a>\", and that this is at the root of the inability of the authorities to tackle rising crime and insecurity, and the failure to enforce the rule of law. The right to bail, not the paucity of investigations and evidence, is assailed as a barrier to the state jailing suspected terrorists and poachers. Rights to privacy are held up as impediments in the war against terror just as rights to personal choices are held to be the causes of the supposed moral breakdown of society.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">This is, of course, not very different from the excuses regularly offered up for the policing of women. According to <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Rachel Spronk</span>, in her book <em>Ambiguous Pleasures: Sexuality and Middle Class Self-perceptions in Nairobi</em>, \"sexuality is perceived in every society as essential to the social and moral order\". Its control is thus considered crucial to social cohesion. This reasoning is not, as many seem to suggest, a preserve of the poor and uneducated. As Spronk continues to note, in Kenya, \"different groups of men, such as religious leaders, opinion makers in the media and government authorities, have expressed concern about women who have become \'visible\' through the transformations of the last decade\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">This gives rise to the crude assertions that it is not the violence and humiliation visited upon women that is a threat to order, but rather it is the rights they have won in recent times, the ability to determine their own standards of sexuality, dress and propriety. In similar fashion, the very rights Kenyans spent decades fighting for are increasingly regarded as expendable and those fighting to preserve them branded as naive do-gooders or the puppets of foreign masters. </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Barrier to efficient action</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">It is the rights to expression, assembly and privacy, not the failure to seriously address security issues, to reform security organs as required by law, to properly investigate crimes and to invest intelligence and community relations, that are blamed for rising insecurity.

The rabid reactions to women seeking protection of the right to make their own choices has demonstrated just how far Kenyan society has to go before it can truly describe itself as not just free, but also free of the fear of freedom.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">It is critical that the slide back to the era of dictatorship and a constriction of individual rights is stemmed.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">\"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself - nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyses needed efforts to convert retreat into advance,\" declared US President Franklin D Roosevelt during <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5057/\" target=\"_blank\">his inaugural speech</a> in 1933. Those words still ring true today, more than 80 years later. Kenyans have little to fear from affirming individual rights and choices. Indeed, it is the historic attempts to curtail such rights, first by the British and then by the post-independence regimes, that have been responsible for the endemic poverty, inequality, oppression and instability. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">We must recognise that it is the \"nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror\" of individual liberty fostered by groups that fear losing their power over, and thus their ability to extract rents from, their fellow Kenyans is what is converting our constitutional advance into a retreat into oppression.

This revolution is in the hands of relatives of disappeared persons, who silently, but consistently, have embodied a new form of scientific and political citizenship. People working in factories, office jobs or dedicated to commerce who used to be apolitical have become active agents of change due to the disappearance of a loved person.</p>\r\n<p><span>This \"awakening\" (as many relatives describe it) can be exemplified by Letty \"Roy Rivera\" Hidalgo, mother of two and former teacher, that after the abduction of Roy Rivera from her own house in Monterrey Nuevo Leon, has become one of the most active leaders in the search for the disappeared in Mexico. The transformation of Letty started after waiting for months for police officers to do their job. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>In the face of their dereliction of duty, Letty started her own search for truth. Armed with basic knowledge of computer systems, Letty learnt how to trace the calls that were made from the mobile phone that her son was carrying that day. After a couple of days she managed to find sixteen locations from where the mobile phone of her son had been calling. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>She even took photos of these houses and took the evidence to the pertinent local authority. Then, she insisted for weeks to the local authorities in Nuevo Leon, who finally decided to visit one of the locations she gave them. Inside, they found three persons who had just been kidnapped; along with guns and members of organised crime. Nonetheless her son was nowhere to be seen.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span>Regardless of her success in locating the so called \"security houses\" (places in which kidnapped people are kept), the authorities decided to dismiss her petitions to look into the other possible locations. Four years on and she is still looking for her son. But now, she does the same for hundreds of people who have disappeared in Mexico through <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://fundenl.org/\" target=\"_blank\">FUNDENL</a>, the organisation that she leads. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Together with other relatives of disappeared persons in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Letty has been fundamental in organising effective opposition to \"governmental truths\", including the first ever citizen-led exhumation in 2014, supported by the Team of Peruvian Forensic Anthropologists and the recently created <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://cfc.kzen.mx/\" target=\"_blank\">Citizen-Led Forensics</a> (or Ciencia Forense Ciudadana in Spanish) , and its partner organisation <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://gobernanzaforense.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Gobernanza Forense Ciudadana</a>.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Letty is just one of the sixteen members that today, are part of Citizen-Led Forensics, an ESRC (Economic and Social Research Council, UK) sponsored project based at Durham University that aims to transform the relationship between science and its \"publics\" as we know it. The idea for this project was born in 2011 while living in Colombia and doing an ethnographic research on forensic science. It was then where we thought of a new model to make the right to the truth a reality. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Our feasibility study, carried out during 2013 was possible thanks to the support we received when Arely won the Global Impact Competition of Singularity University in 2012. The idea was to analyse the possibility that relatives of the disappeared could govern technologies usually controlled by \"experts\" to find the truth about the whereabouts of their loved ones. By the time we finished this first ethnographic study, Mexico had almost reached half of the death toll, and approximately half the number of disappeared persons that Colombia reached in <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.centrodememoriahistorica.gov.co/\" target=\"_blank\">50 years of violent conflict</a>. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>The innovation at the heart of Citizen-Led Forensics is simple. Along with relatives of disappeared persons we have created a budding forensic system in which tools such as DNA and forensic databases are public goods, governed by people that have become forensic experts in their own right, while searching for their loved ones. We are convinced this project is a game changer because it breaks the monopoly of truth of the State.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>According to Human Rights Watch and the Mexican Commission of Human Rights, since 2006 there have been approximately <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/11/12/mexico-build-accurate-database-disappeared\" target=\"_blank\">27,000 disappeared persons</a> in Mexico and the numbers are still rising. Even more, none of these numbers count the thousands of migrants that have disappeared in their transit through Mexico. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>In Citizen-Led Forensics we believe that \"<em>the path of the one is the path of the many\"</em>. That is why we need to create a transparent national database. We cannot keep searching for the disappeared 43 at a time. The revolution in human rights and forensic science we are envisioning cannot be possible if we do not start changing the rules of the game one by one. This means that we have to break in the pristine spaces, reserved for scientific experts and bring the public forum back to forensic science. Thus we say, rephrasing <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/12-GIVE-ME-A-LAB-GB.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Bruno Latour</a>: \"Let us into your laboratories and we will change the world.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i>Ernesto Schwartz-Marin holds a PhD in Genetics in Society from University of Exeter, UK.

More than 2,100 troops (or approximately one combat brigade) remain deployed here, five years after the military operation ended, in order to maintain internal security, military spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Aqeel Malik told Al Jazeera.</p>\r\n<p>The majority of those, he said, are deployed at the hundreds of checkpoints and security posts scattered across major roads in the valley.</p>\r\n<p>The checkpoints, however, appear to be doing little to stem the flow of Taliban killings, or to help in apprehending those responsible.</p>\r\n<p>\"Once the Taliban\'s writ was ended here, then the targeted killings began. Now the Taliban are not visible, but they still have a network. Targeted killings are a face of their guerrilla war,\" said Khwaja Khan, a local political leader who is on the Taliban\'s hit list.</p>\r\n<p>Khan said it is \"amazing\" that attacks have occurred in close proximity to checkpoints - as was <span>Hayat\'s</span> killing on November 12 - and that the security forces\' response tactics appear to be ineffective.</p>\r\n<p>\"When there is an attack, they immediately cordon off the area and impose a curfew. So the result is that the attackers get away, but normal people there have to face many difficulties,\" he told Al Jazeera at his home in Mingora, where he says he lives under guard, and seldom leaves due to the threats against his life.</p>\r\n<p>Gulab Sher, another VDC member under threat, asked the question a different way: \"How it is possible for such killings to take place when the army says they have complete \'control\' over Swat?\"</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Targeted for collaborating </i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>Zahid Khan, a tribal elder and member of the Swat Qaumi Jirga (SQJ), a district-wide committee of anti-Taliban leaders, has survived three attempts on his life. The last, in August 2012, saw him shot in the back of his neck but, miraculously, he survived.</p>\r\n<p>\"We are being targeted [by the Taliban] so that the people are silenced, so that we live in fear and terror, so that those who raise their voices have their tongues cut out,\" he said.</p>\r\n<p>Khan praised the army for having ended the rule of Mullah Fazlullah - then the leader of the Swat Taliban and today the TTP\'s national leader - in 2009, but said he finds its role in maintaining security in the post-operation phase lacking.</p>\r\n<p>\"When people take out their guns to protect themselves, they are fired upon by the army,\" he said, adding that the killers appear to be able to attack with impunity.</p>\r\n<p>This appears to be a common complaint among those on the Taliban\'s hit list, with several members of the VDCs and SQJ telling Al Jazeera they were restricted from carrying weapons to protect themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The military, meanwhile, insists that the fact that the Taliban has been reduced to targeted attacks, in an area where suicide bombings, IED explosions, and beheadings had been commonplace from 2007 to 2009, is a victory for the state.</p>\r\n<p>The shift in tactics, however, has been showing results. Although no official figures exist, credible estimates from VDC and SQJ members indicate that more than 100 people have been killed by the Taliban for collaborating with the government and military in recent years. That figure does not include the many unsuccessful attacks, such as the one on Malala Yousafzai, the Nobel Peace Prize co-winner, in 2012.</p>\r\n<p>Malik said that the Taliban has focused on these tribal leaders because they are \"soft targets\", and that they use local, homegrown fighters in order to carry out their attacks.</p>\r\n<p>\"[They target VDC members] because these people worked closely with law enforcement agencies [and the army] in order to end terrorism. So they take revenge against them, and they are also able to show their presence, that we are still active here.\"</p>\r\n<p>By Malik\'s estimates, there are approximately 3,000 VDC members in Swat, of whom 22 are highest on the Taliban\'s hit-list, according to intelligence gained from captured TTP fighters in Swat.</p>\r\n<p>The police, meanwhile, say the issue is being blown out of proportion.</p>\r\n<p>\"You are over-blowing this targeted killing issue. There are different motives. Every society has crime. So this is also a type of crime,\" said divisional Police Chief Abdullah Khan, when asked if his department was placing a priority on finding those responsible for the killings. According to Khan, Swat is \"the most peaceful region in all of Pakistan these days\".</p>\r\n<p>His junior officers also seemed hesitant to credit the Taliban\'s campaign of targeted killings with the murders of the VDC members, preferring instead to blame tribal rivalries.</p>\r\n<p>\"My opinion is that it is not necessarily a targeted killing every time that a VDC member is killed,\" said Gulzar Khan, the Swat police\'s chief of investigations. \"Every person has their own enmities or issues - whether to do with property, honour or others. And according to our investigations, what we have found is that […] there have been monetary issues behind several of the \'targeted killings\'.\"</p>\r\n<p>Of the 91 murder cases registered in Swat this year, the police say only nine (9.9 percent) were carried out by the Taliban, while VDC and SQJ members say that figure is at least 26 (29 percent).</p>\r\n<p>Few of those cases have resulted in arrests, although in September the military announced the high-profile arrests of a gang of 10 men involved in Malala Yousafzai\'s 2012 shooting. According to the military, this gang was also involved in targeting VDC members in the months following the Yousafzai shooting.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>\'The net is closing\'</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>Despite the police officers\' position on the killings, for those in the Taliban\'s crosshairs, the threat is very real.</p>\r\n<p>\"I feel like the net is closing around me,\" says Sher, a local political leader who has worked closely with the army in the Rang Malah area of Mingora since 2009. \"I basically stay at home most of the time. When I leave the house, I have a pistol with me. I offer my prayers before leaving the house, and recite verses from the Quran having to do with God\'s protection.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"I can\'t leave the house. I have left my business, I just earn a living through properties I have rented out,\" says Zahid Khan, the SQJ leader. \"My social life is over. I can\'t attend funerals or weddings. When I leave Mingora, I do so fearfully, hiding and without telling anyone... I am a captive in my own home.\" </p>\r\n<p>Khan added that he feels abandoned by the army, due to the SQJ\'s criticism of the military\'s continuing role in Swat despite the conclusion of its military operation. \"We do not have guns or artillery, or knives in our hands, we just have the ability to make demands [through the SQJ]. We have demanded our constitutional rights,\" he said.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Asked why he doesn\'t give up his continuing work with the army, Sher\'s answer is perhaps instructive of the realities of living in Swat. \"If I leave this work, the killers will come even faster.\"</p>\r\n<p>The attacks on anti-Taliban leaders who have worked with the government and military in the past are also not isolated to Swat, argues Sartaj Khan, an independent researcher who has studied these attacks since 2007. The Pakistani military has worked through anti-Taliban VDCs and tribal militias (known locally as lashkars) across the country\'s Federally Administered Tribal Areas.</p>\r\n<p>The Pakistani military often touts Swat as a success story, but Malik conceded that the continuing attacks show that \"terrorism is yet to be eliminated\" from the valley, despite the fact that he lauds the peace brought to Swat.</p>\r\n<p>For those on the Taliban hit list, however, Swat appears far from peaceful. Three days after <span>Hayat\'s</span> killing in a Qambar alleyway, Bakht Zarin Khan was <STRONG><i><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-7-284566-Another-peace-committee-member-shot-dea\" target=\"_blank\">killed by Taliban gunmen</a></i></STRONG> in a similar attack in the Tahirabad area of Mingora.</p>\r\n<p>\"They say there is peace here. But there can only be true peace when these targeted killings stop,\" said Gulab Sher. \"How can you say there is peace when I am not safe? This isn\'t peace.\"</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><em>Follow Asad Hashim on Twitter: <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://twitter.com/asadhashim\" target=\"_blank\">@AsadHashim</a></em></i></STRONG></p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/20//2014112095429654734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/20//2014112095429654734_2.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-21 01:51:24','Asad Hashim',34.77364650,72.35990030,NULL,NULL),(347,'2014112014911393766','http://www.aljazeera.com/video/middleeast/2014/11/old-faces-trouble-some-tunisia-voters-2014112014911393766.html','Old faces trouble some Tunisia voters','First democratic presidential elections regarded with caution as several pre-revolution figures seek comeback.','<p>Tunisia is getting ready to hold its first ever democratic presidential election on Sunday.There is controversy about some names on the ballot as former officials from the pre-revolution government are allowed to run for office.</p>\r\n<p>Al Jazeera\'s Nazanine Moshiri reports from Tunis.</p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/20/20141120141545348734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/Images/2014/11/20/20141120141545348734_20.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-21 01:37:51','Al Jazeera',0.00000000,0.00000000,NULL,NULL),(348,'20141120132122265854','http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/egypt-arrests-senior-brotherhood-member-20141120132122265854.html','Egypt arrests senior Brotherhood member','Mohamed Ali Bishr, a former cabinet minister, arrested by authorities in continuing crackdown on the Islamist group.','<p>Egyptian authorities have arrested a leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood in the latest crackdown on the outlawed group.</p>\r\n<p>Mohamed Ali Bishr was arrested at his home in the Nile Delta on Thursday on charges of calling for mass protests on November 28, state media said.</p>\r\n<p>Bishr, a veteran politician who previously served as minister of state for local development, was one of the few Muslim Brotherhood leaders to escape jail after last year\'s overthrow of President Mohamed Morsi.</p>\r\n<p>With much of the leadership in jail, Bishr had played a key role in keeping the Brotherhood\'s activities alive underground, and was also involved in a pressure group that had pushed for Morsi\'s reinstatement and was banned last month.</p>\r\n<p>The group, the National Coalition to Support Legitimacy and Reject the Coup, condemned Bishr\'s arrest, which came a day after 25 protesters were detained in the business district of Cairo.</p>\r\n<p>\"We reject the continuation of rabid attacks against components of the coalition and its members ... and against the sons and daughters of the student protest movement,\" the group said on its Facebook page.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Arrest condemned</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>The Freedom and Justice Party, the political wing of the Brotherhood, condemned the arrest and said Bishr had served seven years in jail from 1999-2002 and from 2006-2010.</p>\r\n<p>Egypt has waged a sweeping crackdown on the Brotherhood since the military ouster of Morsi in July 2013, with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi pledging to end the Islamist group\'s influence during his presidency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Brotherhood has since been labelled a \"terror organisation\" by Egyptian authorities, and tens of thousands of its members have been detained in a clampdown on the groups\'s activities.</p>\r\n<p>On Thursday, prosecutors asked for the death sentence for Morsi and other Brotherhood leaders facing trial on espionage charges, Egypt\'s state news agency said.</p>\r\n<p>Emad el-Sharawy, prosecutor, said that Morsi and his aides leaked state security documents to foreign intelligence agencies, namely Iran, while in office for one year.</p>\r\n<p>El-Sharawy said the defendants, who include Brotherhood leader Mohamed Badie and 34 others, cooperated with groups such as Gaza\'s Hamas to destabilise Egypt.</p>\r\n<p>Once among Egypt\'s best-organised and most successful political movements, the Brotherhood won the first parliamentary and presidential elections after the 2011 Tahrir Square revolution that toppled longtime leader Hosni Mubarak.</p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/20//201411201388338734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/20//201411201388338734_2.jpg',NULL,'Agencies','2014-11-21 01:15:02','Al Jazeera',0.00000000,0.00000000,NULL,NULL),(349,'20141118101511476454','http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/11/us-china-emissions-deal-likel-20141118101511476454.html','The US-China emissions deal likely meaningless','There really isn\'t any mystery about what the world needs to do to avert catastrophic climate change.','<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;

Yes and no. It is quite a significant and consequential political achievement. But it is not particularly important in its direct effect on greenhouse gas emissions.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Whether the agreement ultimately matters to the fate of the world will depend on whether its political impact turns out to be catalytic, spurring not just other political agreements between the world\'s leading greenhouse gas emitters but - quickly - aggressive reductions in greenhouse gas pollution.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">First, as to the agreement\'s political significance. Progress in international climate negotiations and even in US domestic policy has long been handcuffed by disagreements about the allocation of responsibility for action among rich and poor countries, and particularly between the US and China.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">China clearly has the upper hand in this debate. It is plainly true that the industrialised countries are responsible for the overwhelming share of carbon accumulation in the atmosphere. It is also plainly true that the richer countries have more capacity to make needed investments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And, it should be obvious that facing a genuinely global threat, the rich need to do more than the poor, just as rich families need to pay more in taxes than poor families to pay for schools, police, hospitals, roads and other public goods.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Countervailing realities</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">However, there are certain countervailing realities. The most important is that, thanks to its spectacular growth over the last several decades, China is now the<a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/global.html#four\" target=\"_blank\"> world\'s largest emitter of carbon</a> (though it remains behind the US and other rich countries on a per capita basis). Achieving the needed radical reductions in greenhouse gas pollution will require major action from China (and India, and other developing countries). </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Additionally, the US-China trade balance has become so unbalanced that it is economically challenging to impose unilateral costs on US manufacturers (unless they are protected against more carbon-intense imports) and an even bigger problem in terms of domestic US politics.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Against this backdrop, a deal - even a voluntary one - in which both the US and China agree to responsibility for controlling their greenhouse gas emissions is a political breakthrough. It suddenly makes it possible to make progress in world climate talks, and it removes one of the biggest political impediments to the US taking meaningful action on its own and to signing onto a global agreement.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The problem is that this politically significant agreement is incredibly unambitious when it comes to actually reducing greenhouse gas pollution. In the deal, the US agrees to reduce carbon emissions 30 percent from its 2005 level by 2030, and China agrees to keep its 2030 emissions level the same as 2005. This is far too little, and far too slow.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">On the US side, the promised reduction is not only not enough, it\'s pretty close to what the US is going to achieve anyway. The Obama administration has been far too slow and modest in policy-making, but it has significantly increased auto fuel efficiency standards, and it is working now on rules that will also reduce emissions from coal plants and hopefully natural gas, as well. Additionally, market forces are now kicking in so that some meaningful reductions are inevitable without any government intervention; investments in energy efficiency are cost-effective right now throughout the economy - meaning it is cheaper to invest in insulation, better windows, better lighting, more efficient industrial commitment, etc, than to pay increased electricity costs. And, wind and <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://pubc.it/1wMEw8r\" target=\"_blank\">solar energy output is soaring</a> and costs plummeting. In many cases already, wind is cheaper than coal.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Roughly the same holds on the Chinese side. Although the government should be credited for pushing out support for solar and wind energy development, simple cost accounting is now increasingly favouring efficiency, wind and solar over fossil fuels. Many analysts believe <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://theconversation.com/factcheck-does-the-new-climate-deal-let-china-do-nothing-for-16-years-34239\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"InternalLink\">China is</span> already on track</a> to achieve exactly the level promised in the US deal, without any or much additional government action.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">There\'s not really any mystery about what the world needs to do to avert catastrophic climate change, and there isn\'t much difference between the national and global agendas. We need massive investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy. The good news is that, over time, these investments will lower our energy costs. The sun and the wind are free; we just to have to get better at harvesting their energy - major strides have already been made in the last decade. We need large-scale transfers of know-how (intellectual property) and resources from rich to poor countries to speed the transition to a carbon-free future, as well as to help poorer countries adapt to the serious costs that even moderated climate change will impose. And, we have to do all this quickly, because energy savings today are much more important than those in 2045, or even 2030.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">All of this is doable, but it won\'t happen on its own. That\'s why we need binding intergovernmental commitments. The US-China deal doesn\'t do much to reduce greenhouse gas pollution on its own; we have to hope that it does pave the way for future political deals to do just that.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><em><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Robert Weissman is president of Public Citizen.</span></em></i></STRONG></p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/images/2014/11/18//20141118132555912734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/images/2014/11/18/20141118132555912734_20.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-21 01:01:45','Robert Weissman  ',0.00000000,0.00000000,NULL,NULL),(350,'20141120101052223791','http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/11/jerusalem-don-call-it-religio-20141120101052223791.html','Jerusalem: Don\'t call it a religious conflict','Ignoring Israeli occupation and blaming religious hate for deadly attacks makes it sound like violence is inevitable.','<p><span>They are horrifying images of a house of prayer drenched in blood. That an ultra-orthodox synagogue in West Jerusalem was chosen for this latest, gruesome attack, in which four Jewish-Israeli men were killed by two knife-wielding Palestinians, has detonated appalling historic associations and has been widely condemned. This attack has also, inevitably, sparked descriptions of a \"religious war\" in the region - depicted in media headlines as being in various stages of development: either a current reality or an unavoidably impending one. Those who insist on stressing the religious dimension are bolstered by the reaction from Hamas to this attack, as the Islamist group has, with bleak predictability, praised and celebrated it. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>And once again the media framing designates the starting point - and therefore, implicitly, the causes - of the current bloodshed between Israelis and Palestinians. Most importantly, in this context, is the question of who or what set off the religious incitement in Jerusalem.</span></p>\r\n<p>The Israeli government has repeatedly <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/israel-blames-abbas-synagogue-attack-vows-response-103629955.html\" target=\"_blank\">blamed the Palestinian Authority</a> president, Mahmoud Abbas.</p>\r\n<p>But its own security services quickly quashed such accusations: Shin Bet chief, <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.627173\" target=\"_blank\">Yoram Cohen, told a Knesset</a> committee that Abbas (who has no control over Jerusalem) was not involved in igniting violence among East Jerusalem Palestinians.</p>\r\n<p>Indeed, Cohen added, if anyone could be <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4593516,00.html\" target=\"_blank\">accused of exacerbating tensions, Israeli government</a> officials and legislators are the first in line.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>\'Jewish prayer rights\'</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span>For some months now, this hard right coalition government has not just tolerated but actively supported a movement agitating for \"Jewish prayer rights\" at Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif - a sacred site to both Muslims and Jews. Members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\'s own Likud Party are a visible, vocal part of this campaign. There has been a tendency in some quarters to see the prayer issue as a kind of harmless coexistence campaign focused on equal rights. It is not. This movement goes against a long-established status quo agreement, whereby non-Muslims can visit, but not worship at this holy site housing both the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock.  </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span>But more than that, it runs contrary to what Jewish religious leaders have been saying for centuries, which is to rule against Jewish prayer at Temple Mount. Today, there is only one, growingly influential rabbinical strain that says otherwise and that\'s the one guiding the religious-settler movement, which should make it abundantly clear that the issue is political, not religious. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>To play down the provocative nature of these attempts is either misinformed or disingenuous in the extreme. This is, after all, the same movement that talks openly about destroying the Dome of the Rock and replacing it with a <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/minister-calls-for-third-temple-to-be-built/\" target=\"_blank\">third Jewish Temple</a>. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Indeed, Israel\'s housing minister, Uri Ariel - yes, an active minister in the current cabinet - has said that he supports such a project. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>The issue is pushed by the same extremist settler strain that, aided, abetted and funded by the Israeli government, has been colonising swaths of East Jerusalem - the area that is internationally recognised as occupied, the area intended as the capital of a future Palestinian state. </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>National-religious agenda</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span>It isn\'t just Jewish neighbourhoods in the occupied east that are continually expanding; settlers have also taken properties in Palestinian neighbourhoods such as Sheikh Jarrah and non-Jewish parts of the Old City - throwing Palestinian families quite literally out onto the streets. And it is the same movement that - fully supported by the government and the mayor of Jerusalem - has commandeered crucial sites to push a narrow, national-religious agenda. One of these is the <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://electronicintifada.net/content/archaeology-used-politically-push-out-jerusalem-palestinians/7733\" target=\"_blank\">politically charged archaeological park at Silwan</a>, in the heart of the Holy Basin, where dozens of Palestinians have already been evicted.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span> </span></p>\r\n<p><span>So it doesn\'t matter how often Netanyahu says he isn\'t going to change the status quo at the holy sites; the actions of his own coalition create an entirely different impression. Daniel Seidemann, an Israeli lawyer specialising in Israeli-Palestinian relations in Jerusalem, explains that the accelerating, rightist-driven changes in the city have meant that Palestinians \"feel vulnerable and threatened - and they are not being paranoid. The anger is understandable and derives from serious sources\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span>But pushing this conflict into the religious realm, defining it as a \"religious war\", serves a clear political purpose. It means the Israeli government can bind its cause with the \"war on terror\", claiming that Palestinians are just like ISIL in their motivation - a hyper-violent, hyper-fundamentalist jihadi mission rather than a quest for self-determination. It deprives Palestinians of cause or motivation, save for just one factor: religious hatred. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>So in other words, never mind that the Palestinians in Jerusalem have lived under a punitive occupation for decades. Never mind that they are blatantly treated as second-class citizens, subjected to intense surveillance, harassment and arrests (<a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.afp.com/en/news/knife-attacks-kill-two-israelis-unrest-spreads\" target=\"_blank\">900 in East Jerusalem since July</a>); that they routinely deal with settler violence, house demolitions, chants of \"Death to Arabs,\" and curtailed access to religious sites. Never mind the prevailing and overriding message that their lives count less than others. For if the horrifying spate of attacks in Jerusalem are exclusively about innate hatred for Jews - well, how can anything else even matter?  </span></p>\r\n<p>In this religious-hate reading lies a terrible danger: It implies that there is no way out and no solution; that the violence is inevitable.

','<p><span>From the capture of Mosul by ISIL to the siege of Kobani, the political and media focus on what used to be called the Syrian civil war has changed. The battlefield has become more complex as the images have become ever more brutal.<br /> <br /> Yet one thing has not become more complex: the human suffering on the part of millions of Syrians fleeing their homes in fear of their lives, or stuck in them desperately trying to survive. It is vital that the new focus in the west on military options does not come at the expense of two humanitarian tragedies - one, inside Syria, continuing, and another, in the neighbouring countries, in the making.<br /> <br /> Inside Syria, fighting between the government of Bashar al-Assad and opposition forces is intensifying, exacerbating the dire humanitarian conditions already endured by its traumatised population. Relentless violence and insecurity hinder access to half of the 11 million people desperately in need of aid. The number trapped in besieged areas - a quarter of a million people in Damascene suburbs and Aleppo governorate - remains the same. As the UN Secretary-General put it last month, \"ordinary people are denied the basics required for their survival, food, healthcare, clean water… when assistance is available a short drive away\".<br /> <br /> In June, we called on members of the UN Security Council and key Middle Eastern states to appoint senior diplomats and politicians as humanitarian envoys, focused solely on securing help for those in need. Such top-level commitment is even more urgently necessary today than it was five months ago.<br /> <br /></span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span>The second, emerging tragedy is the increasing inability of Syria\'s neighbours to maintain the levels of hospitality they have extended to those fleeing the conflict over the past three and a half years. Since fighting broke out, the one escape route open to Syria\'s terrified (and typically multiply displaced) civilians has been across its borders and into Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey or Iraq. Together, these states have taken in more than three million Syrian refugees. Their governments have provided assistance to the most vulnerable and to the communities who host them, and have supported the efforts of NGOs to deliver vital services to those affected by the conflict. Their contribution makes them by some measures the biggest humanitarian donors to relief efforts in the region.<br /> <br /> But these four countries\' economies, basic services and infrastructure can no longer cope. Syrian refugees now constitute a third of Lebanon\'s population. Jordan, one of the most water-starved nations on the planet, hosts more than 600,000 registered refugees, proportionally equivalent to the United States absorbing the population of the United Kingdom. The two countries have the highest per capita ratios of refugees worldwide, and their populations, along with those of Turkey and Iraq, are struggling to bear the growing burden - from overcrowding in schools and hospitals and spiralling living costs to stretched social fabric.<br /> <br /> Consequently, the four countries are taking measures to control the flow of refugees, targeting help on the most vulnerable. In 2013, the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR, registered an average of 150,000 new Syrian refugees every month in the Levant. This year, the monthly average has dropped to 78,000, and in October - despite the increasing violence in Syria - the agency registered just 18,453. Thousands of traumatised civilians are now trapped on or near the country\'s borders: Fighting prevents their return home, or they have no homes to return to. Five months of heavy rain, snow and sub-zero temperatures lie ahead.<br /> <br /> This dangerous scenario is the result of a collective international failure to mobilise sufficient support for those countries whose proximity to Syria fates them to be beacons of hope for those desperate to get out. There are a number of steps that urgently need to be taken. Donors should work with Syria\'s neighbours to establish safe border crossing mechanisms for all those wishing to do so, regardless of their age, ethnicity, or political background. UNHCR\'s 2014 appeal for Syrian refugees - still only half-funded - must be supported.<br /> <br /> Syria\'s neighbours should receive the direct financial assistance they urgently require to plug the widening gaps in their basic services, repair their buckling infrastructure and create income-generating opportunities, to the benefit of both refugees and the communities that host them. Even if the conflict in Syria ended tomorrow it would take decades to rebuild the country; longer-term developmental support - allowing Syria\'s neighbours to rebuild and fortify their shaken economic and social infrastructure - will therefore be key.<br /> <br /> There is also another, symbolic but important, way in which those outside the Middle East can shoulder a fairer share of the burden. Less than two percent of the millions of Syrians sheltering in neighbouring countries are being offered resettlement outside the region. No state - with the exception of Germany - has allowed more than a token few to receive protection within its borders: The 18,453 registered by UNHCR last month is more than double the number the rest of the world has taken in through the agency\'s programmes since the Syrian conflict began. This constitutes a depressing collapse of international humanitarian solidarity, and can only lead to further destabilisation and misery in the region and beyond. UNHCR has set itself the target of securing the resettlement of 130,000 of the most vulnerable refugees by 2016. That is a beginning, and the world\'s wealthier countries should work to achieve it.<br /> <br /> As long as the violence inside Syria rages on and the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate, those inside the country will keep trying to get out. The responsibility to shelter those fleeing lies with the whole world. Meeting it grows daily more urgent.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i>David Miliband is the president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee and was UK Foreign Secretary 2007-2010. </i></STRONG></em></p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/images/2014/11/20//20141120114430853734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/images/2014/11/20/20141120114430853734_20.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-21 00:58:33','David Miliband',36.21168280,37.14729980,NULL,NULL),(352,'2014111612453777162','http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/headtohead/2014/11/should-poor-pay-rich-2014111612453777162.html','Should the poor pay for the rich?','Mehdi Hasan challenges former Reagan economic adviser Arthur Laffer on whether slashing taxes helps rich and poor.','<p>Arthur Laffer has been described as \"the father of supply-side economics\" and the legendary economist laid some of the intellectual foundations for Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher\'s economic policies in the 1980s.</p>\r\n<p>In this episode of <em> Head to Head</em>, Mehdi Hasan will challenge Arthur Laffer and ask whether free market economics help or hinder the world in the wake of the economic crisis.

He diagnosed himself as a digital addict - after researching the symptoms online, of course - but now feels the need to disconnect.</p>\r\n<p>We follow him as he checks into a digital detox facility and attempts to adapt to a life without his devices. Along the way, we explore the modern phenomenon of digital addiction.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i> From the correspondent: </i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><em>By Phil Lavelle</em></p>\r\n<p>Would you - a shy Brit - spend a weekend locked up in a forest with a load of crazy Americans? Would you give up your phone, tablet and every other digital device you own? I did both this summer - and initially felt like I was on the edge of a nervous breakdown.</p>\r\n<p>My journey started in a hotel restaurant in February. As I sat there, minus my laptop (which was charging in my room), I surveyed the table in front of me. There was a smartphone, a tablet, a pair of noise cancelling headphones and a Kindle, not to mention the fitness band on my wrist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It hit me as clear as day: I was an addict, a digital addict. I hadn\'t even been able to leave my hotel room and travel two floors without taking my swag along with me.</p>\r\n<p>I discussed it with friends and realised that I wasn\'t alone. A 10-minute walk to the station isn’t complete without a pair of white headphones; a dinner date isn’t fully realised unless we break off mid-conversation to talk virtually with a person in another time zone about something trivial.</p>\r\n<p>So I went on a quest to find out why. Travelling across the US, I spoke to a psychiatrist who explained the chemical release that comes from being connected - it\'s the same one cocaine addicts get; to a former Apple employee who revealed why their stores have ex-SWAT team members hiding in them; and to Randi Zuckerberg, who shared her fears about what all of this technology is doing to the brains of children the world over. The message was clear: we are hooked on a legal, electronic drug.</p>\r\n<p>My next stop was a digital detox camp deep in the Californian countryside, where, along with all the other addicts there, I had my electronics confiscated. It is a place where all talk of age and employment is considered blasphemous. The logic is simple - when we meet people, we tend to ask a name and what a person does and instantly form a first impression based on that. The camp organisers wanted everybody - from whatever background and with whatever issues - to be on a clean slate.</p>\r\n<p>I hated it at first. I really did. It is a place that aims to take people back to a point in their lives when they were truly happy and carefree: childhood. Hence the traditional American summer camp. The problem was that, as a Brit, I’d never been to a summer camp and just didn’t get it. On my first night, as I watched the campers dress up, dance on tables and sing Gotye\'s <em>Somebody That I Used To Know</em> - but replacing every word with \'miaow\' - I couldn’t think of anywhere I wanted to be less.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I soon warmed to it. Perhaps it was the tranquility, the laughter yoga (Google it), the campfires, rediscovering the art of meaningful conversation or writing a journal with the aid of a typewriter, but four days later, as I sat with 300 strangers who\'d become friends, I cried. I had just had one of the most exhilarating experiences of my life, and I was dreading the moment when that paper bag containing the keys to my digital identity would be handed back to me.</p>\r\n<p>As I left the camp, I pondered what would happen when I turned the smartphone back on. But, when I eventually did - three hours later - the barrage of notifications didn’t deafen me. In fact, I was surprised by how few people had tried to contact me during the four days I\'d been off the grid. It was a testament to what I\'d learned at the camp: that only a handful of interactions are really worth our time and emotions.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i> From the filmmaker: </i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><em>By Jonathan Richards</em></p>\r\n<p>Digital addiction is a subject that\'s rather too close to home. You see, I feel that my \'attachment\' to my phone and the internet (justified by being a busy filmmaker and needing to be always available), is in no way different to that of Phil Lavelle, your correspondent. And that\'s the power of this film. It resonates very personally. Addiction to our hand-held devices is everywhere. And I\'ll let you into a little secret: some of my viewing-guests didn\'t even have time to watch the whole edit as they were drawn away by an important SMS, Facebook post or some other digitally inspired malady.</p>\r\n<p>At the heart of this story, is an unease about our digital futures. It\'s unclear what the future holds for the human race with regards to our use, or over use, of devices. But one thing is quite clear: we are chemically and psychologically addicted.</p>\r\n<p>Whether this is an actual problem, simply a phase or the start of the downfall of our ability to form analogue relationships, is unclear. And while our film offers, on the one hand, a solution to the \'problem\' of digital addiction, it also raises many more questions than it answers.</p>\r\n<p>My puzzlement with this issue was neatly summarised by a fellow filmmaker, who said of the film: \"Are they really all so weak that they need someone to nanny them and tell them to put down their phones and stop playing with their computers?\" And I guess that’s that problem. We really all seem to be too weak to simply do this - turn off the phone, put it down and step away. The forces at play in the centre of our digital addiction seem real and powerful. Dopamine released by using Facebook and Twitter, along with a psychological condition called the Variable Ratio Schedule, point ominously to a future where only our own will can save us.<br /> </p>\r\n<hr style=\"width: 480px;\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span> When Al Jazeera correspondent Phil Lavelle came to the conclusion that he was addicted to his digital devices, he headed to a digital detox camp.

The manner in which these and other laws were passed and enforced by local authorities in Latino neighbourhoods created a toxic climate of fear for immigrants such as Ramirez, but appear to have backfired, according to Ray Ybarra, a civil rights and criminal defence attorney. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who rose to national fame for his iron-fisted approach in dealing with undocumented immigrants, had to limit his crackdown on immigration after a federal <STRONG><i><a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/10/02/arizona-sheriff-arpaio-racial-profiling/2910887/\">judge ruled</a></i></STRONG> his officers violated civil rights of Latinos during his immigration sweeps.

It was called deferred action from deportation, or DACA.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Since then, more than 40 states have supported the idea of granting driver licenses to recipients of DACA.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Arizona, however, is not one of them.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>\'Show me your papers\'</i></STRONG></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The recent overwhelming election of the state\'s Republican Governor Doug Ducey, who ran on a border security platform and supports his predecessors ban on licenses for DACA beneficiaries, was a bucket of cold water for some.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">While advocates argue the movement to have a city ID is a positive step forward for the state, they say the shift is barely noticeable in the day-to-day life of undocumented immigrants.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"I\'ve said goodbye to too many of my friends,\" said Ramirez about people who were either deported or left the state willingly. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Also, there is a mixed bag of state laws still in effect which combined with federal policies, make it risky for an undocumented immigrant to drive to work for fear of being pulled over by police.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"mceVideoBox\" style=\"width: 330; height: 186; float: Right;\">\r\n<div id=\"bc_3893641748001\" style=\"width: 330; height: 186;\"><!-- --></div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The \"show me your papers\" portion of SB 1070 has survived legal challenges so far and makes it mandatory for police to question someone about their legal status if the police have \"reasonable suspicion\" that person is in the country illegally.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"The experiment [in Arizona] helped deport two million people,\" said Carlos Garcia, director of PUENTE, a grassroots group that works to stop deportation of immigrant families. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Garcia said Arizona played a big role as a laboratory for laws such as SB 1070, which have inspired other states to follow suit, and together contributed to the <STRONG><i><a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2014/11/14/headlines/immigrant_advocates_sue_obama_admin_over_record_deportations\">record deportations</a></i></STRONG> of the Obama administration.

Bouchra is a powerhouse of energy working in Larache in the north, where she is determined to change the culture of misogyny and champion girls’ education. Hannane is warm and compassionate, working to explain the true teachings of Islam and expose superstition, misinterpretation and blind adherence to tradition.</p>\r\n<p>In this film, we follow these three Morchidat as they work in mosques, schools and prisons around the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>By Rosa Rogers</p>\r\n<p>We first heard about the Morchidat through a Chinese newspaper which announced the start of a new programme in Morocco to train women as religious leaders. They were to work alongside male imams in mosques but also to have a wider role in society, working in schools, orphanages, prisons, hospitals and other public institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only a year before, Casablanca had been devastated by an unforeseen terrorist attack which claimed many lives. The article said this new generation of religious leaders were setting out to bring a deeper understanding of Islam to the wider population, and especially to women.</p>\r\n<p>We approached the Moroccan embassy in the UK and told them we were interested in making a documentary about the Morchidat and almost a year later we were invited to meet the Ministry of Islamic Affairs in Rabat, together with a Moroccan producer, Merieme Addou. As a Muslim woman she felt that what the Morchidat were doing was ground-breaking and she became associate producer on the film.</p>\r\n<p>There were many suspicions. There had been a lot of international news coverage about the Morchidat and the ministry felt much of it had been misrepresentative. They wanted to know what our intentions were and what we wanted to say about Islam. They agreed to us going ahead in principle, but we were later to discover that filming a long-term observational documentary was going to be difficult, and that each trip would present a new set of struggles to regain permissions.</p>\r\n<p>We went to a mosque where a Morchidat was working and were overwhelmed by the number of women present and how passionate they were about the work of the Morchidat. They all told us that before this, they had had nobody to talk to about how to resolve problems in their lives, no one to explain their religion to them, no support in everyday spiritual life. Their overwhelming enthusiasm convinced us this was a story worth telling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We met Bouchra and Karima while they were in the final stages of training and they told us with conviction and passion about the problems in their country and how they wanted to change them. Girls not getting educated, being married too early, young people wanting to emigrate to the West, people not helping each other in times of need. We knew we had found two of our characters. And we met Hannane soon after.</p>\r\n<p>Filming <em>Casablanca Calling</em> was the most challenging experience of my filming career. The endlessly changing permits needed for every place we filmed in and the cultural suspicion of cameras meant that for every day we were able to film, there were five or six days which came to an abrupt halt.

Hundreds of thousands of Zimbabweans are kept alive by anti-retroviral drugs (ARVs) given freely by aid agencies on condition that they are not re-sold and that they are used for treating those in need. The drugs have played a vital role in stabilising a situation that was running out of control a decade ago, citing the death rate by more than two-thirds.</p>\r\n<p>However, any interruption in the supply of those drugs to a patient can seriously affect their health, as HIV expert Professor Rudi Luthy of the Newlands clinic in Zimbabwe\'s capital Harare explained.</p>\r\n<p>\"Because HIV is stored away in many cells that are long living, the moment you stop the treatment these cells start replicating the virus - the virus grows and then the next dose comes, and then resistance emerges. You need to take your drugs religiously - you must not miss a single tablet .... if you interrupt or stop the treatment or take it every other day, it\'s bound to fail.\"</p>\r\n<p>Which is why it is so disturbing that the regular supply of ARV is reportedly being disrupted by theft and corruption.</p>\r\n<p>While most patients have experienced no problems maintaining their dosages, other have begun to notice shortages. Lengie Francisco is one such. She is 38 years old and has lived with HIV for nearly eight years. She picks up her ARV prescription from a local clinic every month but recently she has begun to notice that the sealed pill bottles have been opened and the number of tablets inside have been cut dramatically.</p>\r\n<p>\"Some people are saying is that there\'s a shortage,\" she explained. \"Perhaps they\'re trying to share them out equally – but they don\'t want to tell us the truth. Sometimes when you go to the clinic they tell you \'wait, we haven\'t got any supply yet\'.\"</p>\r\n<p>The problem is even worse in rural areas. An HIV sufferer who lives in Mhondoro, five hours from the capital, explained that the drugs were becoming harder to find: \"I went to the hospital and I could not get them. You can only find it on the black market.\"</p>\r\n<p>As Zimbabwean health reporter Cassim John discovered while making this disturbing film for <em>Africa Investigates</em>, the medicines are somehow being siphoned out of hospitals, clinics and the national pharmaceutical network and then sold on the black market – often for use as recreational narcotics.</p>\r\n<p>So who is responsible for this illegal trade and why is it being allowed to flourish?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watch more <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/africainvestigates/\"><em>Africa Investigates</em></a> for reports by undercover African journalists who face intimidation, beatings and death threats.</p>\r\n<div></div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/19/20141119161029469734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/Images/2014/11/19/20141119161029469734_20.jpg',NULL,NULL,'2014-11-20 20:24:52','Al Jazeera',0.00000000,0.00000000,NULL,NULL),(363,'201411205232142934','http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia-pacific/2014/11/nurses-stabbed-death-at-china-hospital-201411205232142934.html','Nurses stabbed to death at China hospital','Attack in women\'s staff dormitory at 281 Hospital in Beidaihe carried out by man with a \"a history of mental illness\".','<p>Six nurses and a co-worker at a Chinese hospital have been knifed to death by another member of staff at a female employees\' dormitory, state media said.<br /><br />The man who carried out Thursday\'s attack in the resort town of Beidaihe in the northern province of Hebei told police he had \"a history of mental illness\", state news agency Xinhua said.<br /><br />The suspect was named as Li Xiaolong by state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV), adding he was about 27 and had been detained by police. <br /><br />The attack was carried out early on Thursday \"in the women\'s staff dormitory at the 281 Hospital in Beidaihe\", it said in an online post, and another nurse had been wounded.<br /><br />Chinese hospitals have seen a series of violent attacks, but they are more often carried out by angry patients against medical staff.<br /><br />In April a 45-year-old man unhappy with his circumcision stabbed a doctor to death in the eastern province of Jiangsu.

People know this, and they are abandoning the official story of development in droves. They no longer believe that foreign aid is some kind of silver bullet, that donating to charities will solve anything, or that Bono and Bill Gates can save the world.</p>\r\n<p>This crisis of confidence has become so acute that the development community is scrambling to respond. The Gates Foundation recently spearheaded a process called the Narrative Project with some of the world\'s biggest NGOs - Oxfam, Save the Children, One, etc. - in a last-ditch attempt to turn the tide of defection. They commissioned research to figure out what people thought about development, and their findings revealed a sea change in public attitudes. People are no longer moved by depictions of the poor as pitiable, voiceless \"others\" who need to be rescued by heroic white people - a racist narrative that has lost all its former currency; rather, they have come to see poverty as a matter of <em>injustice</em>.</p>\r\n<p>These findings clearly demonstrate that people are beginning to reject the aid-centric approach to development. But instead of taking this as an opportunity to face up to their failures and change the way the industry works, the Gates Foundation and its partner NGOs have decided to stick with business as usual - but to cloak it with fresh language.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://therulesblog.org/the-narrative-project-judge-it-for-yourself/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Leaked internal documents</span></a><span> make it clear that the Narrative Project is nothing more than a PR campaign - a bid to \"change public attitudes\" by rolling out fresh language that will be more effective at securing public support and donations. The strategy goes like this: Talk about the poor as \"equals\" who share our values; emphasise that development is a \"partnership\"; stop casting rich people and celebrities as saviours of the poor; and above all, play up the idea of \"self-reliance\" and \"independence\", with special attention to empowering women and girls. Progressive Westerners love this stuff.</span></p>\r\n<p>This new framing amounts to little more than a propaganda strategy. Instead of changing their actual approach to development, the Narrative Project just wants to make people think they\'re changing it. In the end, the existing aid paradigm remains intact, and the real problems remain unaddressed.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span>A failing project</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span>Why do people no longer believe in the charity and aid-centric model of development? According to the Narrative Project, it\'s because they\'re all a bit stupid. They let their personal beliefs override the \"facts\". They\'re \"old\" and \"conservative\". And they\'re too calloused to care about social causes. It doesn\'t occur to the development industry that people might have good reasons for their scepticism. And there are many.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span>For one, the aid project <em>is</em> in fact failing. There have been some achievements, to be sure, but the Gates Foundation and official sources like the UN want the public to believe that these piecemeal gains are tantamount to overall success. They tell us that poverty has been cut in half in the last fifteen years or so, but independent watchdogs have repeatedly shown that this claim rests on statistical </span><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.crop.org/viewfile.aspx?id=218\" target=\"_blank\"><span>sleight-of-hand</span></a><span>. Moreover, it relies on a poverty line of $1.25 a day, which </span><span><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/08/exposing-great-poverty-reductio-201481211590729809.html\" target=\"_blank\">no longer</a> </span><span>has any credibility.

It assumes that poverty is a natural phenomenon, disconnected from the rich world, and that poor people and countries just need a little bit of charity to help them out. People are smarter than that. They know that poverty is a feature of the global economic system that it is very often <em>caused</em> by people, including some of the people who run or profit from the aid agenda. People have become increasingly aware - particularly since the 2008 crash - that poverty is created by rules that rig the economy in the interests of the rich.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span>A system of plunder</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span>We can trace this rigging process through history. The programmes that global South countries used successfully to build their economies and reduce poverty after the end of colonialism - trade tariffs, subsidies, social spending on healthcare and education - were in many cases actively destroyed by Western intervention in the name of \"development\".  Western-backed coups in Iran in 1953, Guatemala in 1954, Congo in 1961, Brazil in 1964, Indonesia in 1965, Chile in 1973 - to name just a few - deposed democratically elected leaders with pro-poor platforms to install dictators friendly to multinational corporations. Most of these dictators received billions of dollars in \"aid\" from Western governments.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>When coups fell out of favour with the voting public, the World Bank and the IMF stepped in instead. They leveraged debts to impose crushing \"structural adjustment\" programmes on poor countries, forcing them to privatise public assets, open their markets to Western goods, cut social spending and reduce wages, and give foreign companies access to extra cheap labour and raw materials. Structural adjustment was one of the greatest single causes of poverty in the global South in the 20th century, and it continues to this day under the guise of \"austerity\" .</span></p>\r\n<p><span>These destructive policies only persist because voting power in the World Bank and the IMF is controlled by rich countries. High-income countries control </span><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.brettonwoodsproject.org/2010/04/art-566281/#_ftn1\" target=\"_blank\"><span>more than 60 percent</span></a><span> of the voting power at the World Bank, but are home to </span><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/income-level/OEC\" target=\"_blank\"><span>less than 15</span></a><span> percent</span><span> of the world\'s population.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Right now, developing countries lose as much as </span><span><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://iff.gfintegrity.org/iff2012/2012report.html\" target=\"_blank\">$900bn</a> </span><span>each year to tax evasion by multinational companies through trade mispricing, and almost </span><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Wkd0--M6p_oC&printsec=frontcover&dq=capitalism%27s+achilles+heel&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MMrzU7fGPIWe0QWzqICgDA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=capitalism\'s%20achilles%20heel&f=false\" target=\"_blank\"><span>the same sum again </span></a><span>through transfer pricing.

It is a state of plunder. It is delusional to believe that charity and aid are meaningful solutions to this kind of problem.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Some people in the NGO community know this all too well, and they are calling for genuine political change: The democratisation of the World Bank and the IMF, fairer trade rules, and an end to tax evasion. But because the leadership at the Gates Foundation and some NGOs find these issues inconvenient  such alternative voices are being side-lined in favour of a disingenuous attempt to \"fix\" public attitudes by pushing ever harder on the same old charity and aid story.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>If the Gates Foundation and NGO leadership want to get serious about tackling poverty, they might start by talking to the public about the importance of releasing developing countries from the siphons of rich countries and their corporations. They might help put the final nails in the coffin of the paternalistic story of charity and aid, white saviours and poor brown victims, and tell the real story about how the rich get richer off the backs of the poor. That would be a true starting point for development in the 21st century.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i>Dr Jason Hickel lectures at the London School of Economics and serves as an adviser to <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.therules.org/\" target=\"_blank\">/The Rules</a>.</i></STRONG></em></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span dir=\"ltr\">Martin Kirk, Global Campaigns Director of <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.therules.org/\" target=\"_blank\">/The Rules</a>, contributed to the analysis for this article.</span></i></STRONG></em><em style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><STRONG><i> </i></STRONG></em></p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/images/2014/11/17//20141117132746788734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/images/2014/11/17/20141117132746788734_20.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-20 18:00:06','Al Jazeera',18.97118700,-72.28521500,NULL,NULL),(369,'201411197130293973','http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/jerusalem-conflict-spreads-bethlehem-201411197130293973.html','Jerusalem conflict spreads to Bethlehem ','Jerusalem tension is spilling over into Bethlehem where Palestinians fear \'something big coming\'.

Seventy-one Israelis were also killed, most of them soldiers.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p> Israel has increased its police force exponentially in Jerusalem in the past few weeks in an attempt to curb the violence, but many Palestinians say their long-simmering frustrations over what they call Israel\'s unjust measures and difficult living conditions are finally boiling over.</p>\r\n<p>\"Israel has increased its violations against al-Aqsa, and crackdowns on people on checkpoints, and through red tape,\" Enas said.</p>\r\n<p>\"All this leads to violence. All this pressure will ultimately lead to an explosion. As you can see, home demolitions have not stopped attacks. Violence breeds violence.\"</p>\r\n<p>For decades, Israel has demolished homes of Palestinians accused of carrying out attacks. But in 2005, the practice, which authorities said was necessary for \"deterrence\", was halted.</p>\r\n<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week pledged to speed up the demolitions of homes of those involved in attacks. This came a day after two Palestinian men - also from Jerusalem - killed five Israelis in a synagogue in the western part of the city.</p>\r\n<p>Human rights groups had long maintained that home demolitions were an act of collective punishment.</p>\r\n<p>\"It doesn\'t deter; on the contrary, it inflames and increases the hatred even more,\" said Jeff Halper, the founder of the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions.\"What it does is it helps the Israeli people feel that they\'ve been avenged.\"</p>\r\n<p>In 2004, Moshe Ya\'alon, a former army chief of staff, formed a review committee to look into the practice of punitive home demolitions. The committee found that it did more harm to Israeli interests, than it did to deter future attacks.</p>\r\n<p>Home demolitions began again in August when the houses of two of the men involved in the abduction and killing of three Israeli teens were destroyed in Hebron. Another home belonging to a third man was sealed.</p>\r\n<p>Israeli authorities had long maintained that fear of house demolitions led to families turning in their relatives to stop them from carrying out attacks.</p>\r\n<p>\"AbdelRahman died, but what about us?\" Amer said. \"Why must we suffer?

He had signed for $5 a month which, in 1956, was a very good salary in Portugal.</p>\r\n<p>But money was never his main concern. In all the time he has been playing for FC Penafiel, he has never signed a new contract. His salary has increased several times, but based only on verbal negotiations.</p>\r\n<p>“I would tell club presidents how much I needed and they would oblige,” Pereira tells Al Jazeera. “Your word was enough in those days.”</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Financial loss</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>FC Porto, Benfica, Sporting, Boavista and Vitória de Guimarães have tried to hire him but Pereira has never broken his “eternal connection” with FC Penafiel, the small team from the city where he was born.</p>\r\n<p>The refusal has also meant a lost opportunity of going from a lower division to the top league. His motto has always been to play for the love of the game and FC Penafiel repaid his love by not selling him, even when there were tempting offers.</p>\r\n<p>Rival clubs had a hard time approaching the player. Some fans almost beat up an FC Porto director who tried it. Four years later, Vitória de Guimaraes tried its luck but fans organised an extraordinary assembly to stop Pereira from leaving the club.</p>\r\n<p>He lost out on a better wage which would have assured his “financial independence”.</p>\r\n<p>“It’s a farce nowadays,” Pereira adds. “I could have earned a lot of money. Obviously not as much as footballers today though. The wages are crazy now. I can’t even calculate how much they earn. When I see players who have just joined a team score a goal and kiss the club’s logo, I think it is a farce. They only think about money.”</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Humble background</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>As a kid, Pereira used to help his father, who worked as a tailor, and his mother with household chores. But whenever he had some free time, he would play football with his friends in the streets - barefeet and with a ball made of rags.</p>\r\n<p>He was the second oldest of five and could only manage to study until the fourth grade.</p>\r\n<p>His childhood was not trouble-free, especially as he grew up during WWII. But later, he would escape to play football close to the river. He was punished for that but it was in that very place that FC Penafiel discovered him.</p>\r\n<p>Money or fame was never Pereira’s ambition. His connection with the club was so strong that when the team lost at home, he would take a different route home because he would feel ashamed of going through the city centre.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Special award</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>Pereira’s professional career ended in 1986 but he did sign off with a tremendous record and a special distinction from the Portuguese Football Federation. During his 20-year career, he scored 600 goals and never got a yellow or red card.</p>\r\n<p>Next month, Pereira will be 76. The secret of his fitness seems to be his healthy lifestyle and love for the game.</p>\r\n<p>“I exercise on my own. I run and jump for at least an hour. I play football with my grandson, who also plays in a club but who has not put my surname on his shirt to avoid comparisons.”</p>\r\n<p>Apart from representing the club as a player, Pereira has coached all of the FC Penafiel teams - from the school team to the professional one. Now, he has a new challenge. He has been appointed coach of the veterans team where he still plays.</p>\r\n<p>“I am not going to teach them anything, because they know everything. They have to play like veterans. A veteran has to play with a ball on his foot. We cannot run like when we were 18 because we’d be dead after a few minutes.”</p>\r\n<p>Pereira does not quite know when he will hang up his boots. But he does know that he wants to go on until he can – for the love of the game and FC Penafiel.</p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/19//2014111914495563734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/19//2014111914495563734_2.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-20 02:04:45','Filipa Soares',39.39987200,-8.22445400,NULL,NULL),(398,'20141119135325198451','http://www.aljazeera.com/sport/cricket/2014/11/late-wickets-halt-pakistan-progress-20141119135325198451.html','Late wickets halt Pakistan\'s progress','New Zealand look to take first-innings lead after Pakistan finish day three still 122 runs behind and four wickets left.','<p>Younis Khan and Azhar Ali featured in a century-plus stand to prop up Pakistan but New Zealand claimed three wickets in the final session to stay ahead in the second Test in Dubai.</p>\r\n<p>Resuming on 34 for two, Pakistan enjoyed a smooth morning session but lost Younis (72) after lunch and Azhar (75) and two other batsmen after tea to finish day two on 281 for six, still 122 runs behind the tourists.</p>\r\n<p>Sarfraz Ahmed (28) and Yasir Shah (one) were in the middle at stumps with Pakistan, who lead the three-match series 1-0, still trailing New Zealand by 122 runs with four wickets in hand.</p>\r\n<p>After cheaply removing Pakistan\'s openers late on Tuesday, New Zealand needed early wickets to take the upper hand but were thwarted by Younis and Azhar, who negotiated pace bowlers with aplomb and used their feet effectively against spinners.</p>\r\n<p>Younis, who turns 37 later this month, was the more aggressive of the two, hitting off-spinner Mark Craig for two sixes - one over long on and the other over midwicket.</p>\r\n<p>After dominating his 113-run third wicket stand with Azhar, Younis was dismissed by Jimmy Neesham, having extended the red hot form that had produced three centuries and a double hundred in his last six Test innings.</p>\r\n<p>Sodhi was the pick of the New Zealand bowlers with two wickets for 65 runs.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Scorecard:</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>New Zealand 403 all out (Latham 137, Babar 4-137)</p>\r\n<p>Pakistan 281-6 (Younis 72, Sodhi 2-65)</p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/images/2014/11/19//20141119141129533734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/images/2014/11/19/20141119141129533734_20.jpg',NULL,'Reuters','2014-11-20 01:13:50','Al Jazeera',25.07661460,55.13565450,NULL,NULL),(399,'2014111985741755631','http://www.aljazeera.com/weather/2014/11/snow-smothers-parts-new-york-state-2014111985741755631.html','Deadly snowstorm hits parts of New York state','At least seven people killed as severe cold continues to grip northeastern US and Canada.','<p>Heavy snow has choked parts of New York state, stranding motorists in their cars, forcing people to remain indoors and leaving at least seven people dead.</p>\r\n<p>The snow has been very localised: Buffalo Airport reported just 9cm of snow, whereas the suburb of Lancaster, just five kilometres away, reported a staggering 1.52 metres.</p>\r\n<p>The snow that fell was what is known as \"lake effect\" snow.

Given its sensitivities, few dare tread into its complexities. Instead, the focus has often been on dealing with Gaza first. During the Oslo process, \"Gaza [and Jericho] first\" was the accepted beginning, and Ariel Sharon chose an exit out of Gaza as the means of creating a new political reality. Even former US Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice was kept busy with Gaza, and in particular the Rafah crossing - a level of diplomatic resolution unusual for someone at her level. Gaza is a crucial issue that demands attention and resolution; however, as we are witnessing today, leaving Jerusalem aside is not without consequences.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/palestinians-suffer-israeli-settler-reprisals-20141118185543648426.html\" target=\"_blank\">recent violence </a>has been triggered by two factors. The first is the threat of changes to the status quo on the Haram Al Sharif or Temple Mount, the holiest site in the city for both Muslims and Jews. The new and rising demand by right wing Jewish religious groups to pray on the platform is eliciting much negative reaction by Palestinians. Given the deep distrust about Israeli intentions, changing the status quo on that site is perceived as a further encroachement of Israeli control over a Muslim site. The desire to pray may seem benign, but, as long as the conflict remains unresolved, it weaves dangerously into the fiery politics around the site.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The second factor has to do with the <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/east-jerusalem-under-collective-punishment-2014111682924491709.html\" target=\"_blank\">status of Palestinian East Jerusalemites</a>. They compose one third of the population of the city, they have a special Israeli ID for \"residents of Jerusalem\", but they are not Israeli citizens, and they view the Israeli presence as an occupation, mostly rejecting any role in municipal politics. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Their status points to a larger problem. Arab Jerusalem was always naturally connected to its Palestinian hinterland until Israel built the wall around the city for security reasons, separating it from the West Bank. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">East Jerusalemites can still go to the West Bank, but the process is complicated and time consuming. More importantly, West Bankers need permits, acquired only with great difficulty, to enter Jerusalem. The natural social and economic linkages between the West Bank and Jerusalem have been broken.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Jewish identity</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Furthermore, over the last 10 years, East Jerusalem has undergone a slow but sure process of changes on the ground. From new Jewish settlements, to re-zoning of green space, to the renaming of street names, the Arab character and reality of the city is being slowly eroded in favour of Jewish identity. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Some Israelis believed that the economic benefits that accrued to Arab Jerusalemites through their blue residents ID and links to Israel, would keep them peaceful. However, the changing status of the city and the holy sites, alongside neglect of Arab areas, has trumped this approach.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The power of religoius symbols and national identity, as well as the need for authentic, and not ersatz, autonomy has turned out to be more powerful. Time ran out, and Palestinian Jerusalemites rejoined their brethren in the West Bank and Gaza in fighting occupation in its many forms. Indeed, the nature of the Palestinian violence, from the use of a car as a weapon, to knives and axes demonstrates that, terrible as they may be, these reactions are neither well-armed nor organised. They are grassroots reactions to the realities that Palestinians are living. The challenge for Israel is homegrown; East Jerusalemites are free to move in the city, and, by Israeli choice, the Palestinian Authortity has no role in the city. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">These factors, together, point to the heart of the problem. Many Israelis, and especially the right wing, have long stated that Jerusalem is their indivisible capital. However, this has translated into changes in the nature the city and now, critically, the holy sites. The very idea that Jerusalem - a city of complex meaning and deep symbolism to billions across the globe - should be controlled by one side may be simply unsustainable, and require examination.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Jerusalem is at the heart of Jewish history and faith, as it is for Christians and Muslims. The panoply of holy sites, especially in and around the Old City, mark these powerful connections, and many are angered when they cannot access them, or when their status appears to change. Israelis experienced these fears before 1967 and Palestinians do today; however, such concerns do not speak to unilateral control as the answer. Indeed, the deeply possesive, and sometimes aggressive, approach to these holy sites may be the very problem. It incorporates a denial and diminishing of the other that can hardly be called religious in any true sense. A lighter touch may provide greater possibility and stability.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The demands on Jerusalem, today and in the future, are many: the capital of two states, Israel and Palestine, the management of holy sites and pligrimage for three monotheistic faiths, and a living city that needs a functioning municipality. There is no shortage of studies and answers to managing all these issues; what is lacking is the political will to effect change.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Need for third parties</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Given the international nature of the city, many of these solutions point to the need for third parties to play a role in the city. Whether through special arrangements or special regimes, this third party role will be necessary for the management of heritage and religious sites, as well as, potentially, for security matters. The <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/netanyahu-attend-crisis-meeting-amman-20141113151226470909.html\" target=\"_blank\">Jordanian role</a>, as stated in the Israeli-Jordanian peace treaty, also cannot be ignored in this regard. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Indeed, the question of security control will be most difficult for Israelis to compromise over. However, it is also one of the most basic barometers of whether various groups have equal treatment and a sense of legitimacy. Today\'s reality leaves the doop open for further radical Israeli expansion. Unchecked, and lured by a potent mix of ideology and the holy sites, their actions have and will elicit an inevitable counter-reaction. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">As<a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/kerry-abbas-discuss-jerusalem-unrest-20141113141357916601.html\" target=\"_blank\"> John Kerry\'s intervention</a> demonstrated last week, talks on Jerusalem can no longer wait. This is not all bad news, the classic approach of leaving the city until last has left it vulnerable to the destructive desires of the most extreme. Practical and symbolic answers to Jerusalem may not only defuse current tensions, they may begin to unravel the very DNA of the conflict, the downward spiral around identity and possession, with positive ripples into the other areas of the conflict. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">No doubt, Gaza requires immediate redress because it is an isolated and besieged place destroyed by war.

They argued that it was unsustainable on all accounts: costing a lot in energy, dedicated mostly to businesses and not to Parisians, and belonging to an already passe brand of gigantic glass buildings such as The Shard, the kind which fits better in Shanghai or London.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Confided to the distinguished world architects Jacques Herzog and Thierry de Meuron (responsible for the Beijing Stadium and the London Tate Modern\'s restructuration), \"Le Triangle\" was conceived as a 180-metre high tower (in comparison, the Eiffel Tower is 324-metres high and Montparnasse Tower just above 200 metres) with 90 percent of its space dedicated to offices and the rest to shops and a creche. Budgeted at around $625 million, it was to be financed by private investors. Hidalgo argued that 5,000 jobs were going to be created for its construction over a five-year period.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">But such practical and pragmatic views are probably not the way to go about architecture in Paris. Of all people, Hidalgo should have known that Paris is a city like no other. You may be able to convince Londoners that another big tower in the City is a good thing for the economy, but not Parisians.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Paris, the most visited city in the world, with 31 million visitors a year (47 million for Greater Paris), is in many ways unique. One of the most densely inhabited cities in the western world, nearly on par with Calcutta, Paris also boasts the highest number of boutiques per inhabitants. And by shops, the Parisians usually mean bakeries, butchers, cheesemongers, patisseries, bookshops and all independent trading places, even though the ratio of franchises has skyrocketed in Paris in the last 10 years with Starbucks coffees and clothes shops replacing old artisan shops.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">City of Lights</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">If Paris still deserves today its epithet the \"City of Lights\", it is precisely because the light can freely flow into its streets and gardens, undisturbed by high-rise buildings such as Le Triangle. As a born and bred Parisian, who has lived almost half her life in London, I oppose skyscrapers projects such as Le Triangle in Paris (we already tried it, it is called La Defense) but I welcome audacious and innovative architecture to complement the beauty of Paris. And Paris is certainly not devoid of such architectural creativity.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Paris is not as conservative a city as one might think. If Baron Haussmann gave her its definite flavour in the 1870s, by piercing huge avenues (to enable the army quell rebellions) and setting the standard of the Parisian immeuble, which should not rise above Notre Dame\'s belfry, Paris has also changed little by little. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Over the last 70 years, Paris has proved both audacious and experimental, for better and for worse. Le Corbusier, for instance, wanted to completely erase the historical centre of Paris and build instead his favourite barres, or tower blocks. Luckily, he was not followed. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">The ring road that encircles Paris, known as Le Peripherique, is now partly covered by gardens, which open up the capital to its banlieues. Whole new quartiers have emerged, for instance from the old docks in the 13th arrondissement. The new National Library was created on this sort of \"Left-South Bank\" and an immense new district of shops, businesses, institutions, universities, cinemas and residential homes have sprung up. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">French presidents have also always been keen on leaving their prints on the French capital: Georges Pompidou was known for being a daring modernist and famously planned to destroy the Orsay Museum (then a train station) and luckily gave us the Pompidou Centre instead; Francois Mitterrand gave us the Louvre Pyramid, while Jacques Chirac commissioned the Branly Museum dedicated to African art. All great architectural successes. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Parisians are not opposed to modernity, quite the opposite.

At a gallery in London, a passerby noticed Nelson\'s almost two-metre tall picture of three august Kazakhs in Mongolia each holding a golden eagle and sitting on horses on a mountaintop above a valley. The passerby stopped and said, \"That is absolutely brilliant. Wow.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Nelson told Al Jazeera he has been intermingling with such communities for all of his 46 years. His father worked for an oil company and he \"grew up in the bush, so to speak\", returning to the UK to attend boarding school. His photos are now part of a museum and commercial exhibition tour in Western Europe and the United States. He says he has taken an ethnographic record of the purity of humanity as it faces extinction.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Taking offence</span></i></STRONG></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">But some indigenous community members are aggravated by his approach, and particularly the title of his work: \"<STRONG><i><a href=\"http://www.beforethey.com/\">Before They Pass Away</a></i></STRONG>\". Some have complained the photos misrepresent the lives of many indigenous groups. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Nixiwaka Yawanawá, from the Yawanawá tribe in western Brazil, held a protest outside the London exhibition in September. Yawanawá works with the tribal rights organisation <STRONG><i><a href=\"http://www.survivalinternational.org/\">Survival International</a></i></STRONG>. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">\"We are not actually passing away, we are struggling to survive,\" Yawanawá said. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">New Zealand\'s Maori community has also <STRONG><i><a href=\"http://jdhq.blogspot.ca/2013/11/were-not-dead-yet.html\">expressed its shock</a></i></STRONG> at being included in the exhibit and considered close to extinction. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">While Nelson says he has photographed the tribe\'s past and present, others say he\'s neglected the fact that he\'s showing its future, too. And the question has been raised as to whether Nelson\'s works have best promoted understanding between indigenous groups and the Western world.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">But Nelson defends his project. \"The title is very, very deliberate and it is meant to get people\'s attention. Something is passing away.\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Some indigenous people agree. Michael Tiampati is a member of a Maasai community in southwestern Kenya and a manager for a network of pastoral organisations. He says an outsider\'s exhibition, including photos of the Maasai wearing piercing red sheets and colossal brown headgear, will help. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">\"It shows the world the reality confronting these communities - the threats to the culture, ways of life and livelihoods,\" he says.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Nelson spent months to achieve some shots, finding the tribes and gaining their trust. It took two weeks to earn the Kazaks\' confidence in order to take their photos. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">He painstakingly arranged compositions, along vast landscapes in bitter conditions. Oftentimes, this meant successive shooting days to capture the best ambient light - the only light used. Nelson, who worked in commercial photography for years, wanted his subjects to present themselves at their proudest, and produce photos glorious enough for a fashion magazine. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">He admits this meant at times changing what they would traditionally wear - using leaves, for instance, to cover the naked women of the Ecuadorian Waorani tribe, or an uncustomary setting such as the Goroka group in Papua New Guinea posed high among treetops.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\'Fake pictures\'?</span></i></STRONG></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Yawanawá argues rather than promoting indigenous cultures, this misconstrues their identities. \"He is faking, they are fake pictures,\" he says. Yawanawá argues Nelson\'s photos conflict with his work to develop public understanding of indigenous people\'s plight.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Nelson launched a book of the photos last year and it\'s been <STRONG><i><a href=\"http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/america-tonight/america-tonight-blog/2013/11/22/jimmy-nelson-photographerdyingtribes.html\">widely covered</a></i></STRONG> in the media. Only since Yawanawá\'s protest has criticism flared, however. Nelson opened the exhibition in Brussels this month, and it is travelling further.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Ironically, Nelson has his own image problem. Yawanawá told Al Jazeera the photographer is working for himself only, otherwise he would convey the communities\' struggle, particularly against government and businesses\' theft of their lands. Nelson selling limited edition books at $8,000 each and prints for $58,000 does not help this portrayal.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The photographer says the large financial investment needed for the project means it can only exist by recouping the money commercially.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">He has in the past also thanked his billionaire <STRONG><i><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/slideshow/2014-01-07/before-they-pass-away.html\">investor</a></i></STRONG> <span>Marcel Boerkhoorn</span>. He adds the sales attract an audience that\'s tired of being confronted by charities\' messages. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Nelson says Survival International is trying to enforce \"in a patronising, despondent, wanton way\" how tribal people are perceived in order that its work continues. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">\"It\'s about money,\" says Nelson. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Different angles</span></i></STRONG></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Orla Bakdal, executive director of the <STRONG><i><a href=\"http://www.iwgia.org/\">International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs</a></i></STRONG>, says while the beautiful photographs stimulate curiosity, <span lang=\"EN-GB\">he is unable to use them for his work, particularly for documentation. Bakdal says </span>the images fail to show the complexity of the tribes\' lives and the often-severe conditions the world\'s 370 million indigenous people live in. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">\"I think we have to approach this serious issue from different angles. It is not fair to those 370 million people that they are just being exhibited like a tourist attraction and object for a photographer,\" Bakdal says. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">A more multi-faceted view - even if by adding written explanations - would provide a fairer representation and best promote understanding with the Western world, she says. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Tiampati, from Kenya\'s Maasai tribe, says he would also have liked to seen an approach inclusive of more tribal members. \"It should have been made through a consultative process so the voice, vision, or ideas of the communities would have been incorporated.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Nelson\'s exhibition will go to New York in February. He says he\'ll then visit 35 more tribes over the next three years, producing a film and more photo shows. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">But right now, he told Al Jazeera, he plans to return to the initial tribes he shot to present his book and, \"Try to get more objectivity.

This committed Iran to freezing much of its nuclear activity - including the especially sensitive enrichment of uranium to 20 percent - in exchange for limited sanctions relief from the West. That deal expired on November 24. Although diplomats are free to keep talking after that date, the problem is that neither side will any longer be bound by these constraints. Iran will be free to resume higher-level enrichment, and the United States to impose fresh sanctions. Lawmakers and hawks in both capitals will agitate for their governments to do precisely this, even if Presidents Barack Obama and Hassan Rouhani want more time. That would take us back to the confrontational and tense atmosphere of 2012 and 2013, where the spectre of military action cast a dark shadow.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">While diplomats acknowledge that great progress has been made in the past year - more than in the previous decade put together - there reportedly remain crucial gaps, specifically over the amount of enrichment that Iran will be permitted to undertake, how long Iran will be bound by any restrictions, and the sequence of sanctions relief. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>An extension?</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Most therefore predict that negotiators will seek an extension of a few months, and perhaps even a \"framework agreement\" that pins down the areas of consensus. If this is the path chosen, they should know that they would face a rapidly closing window for dialogue, one that might snap shut by spring 2015 at the latest. Although Obama would theoretically be able to veto Congress\' attempts at new sanctions, it is less clear whether Iran\'s Supreme Leader would give Rouhani the latitude to keep the nuclear programme frozen.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">As for the content of a deal, the two sides are within touching distance. Consider one crucial aspect. Currently, Iran could produce enough fissile material for one nuclear bomb - although not the bomb itself - in less than two months, a scenario known as \"breakout\". The West wants to extend this to at least a year. As part of any deal, Russia seems <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21632564-russia-makes-big-move-endgame-negotiations-iran-will-it-help-or\" target=\"_blank\">likely to ship out Iran\'s stockpile</a> of enriched uranium to create fuel rods. This helps, but even if we assume Iran starts with no enriched uranium, it would still have to cut its number of first-generation centrifuges down to <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://lewis.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/6874/kemp-setting-a-goal-for-iran-talks\" target=\"_blank\">just over 5,000</a> if the breakout time is to stretch to a year. Iran currently has 18,000 (8,000 are inactive, but this doesn\'t matter for these calculations). According to press reports, the highest reported US offer is 4,500 and the<a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/f99173eb2fc14d36a191b666491539c3/iran-talks-taking-stock-week-deadline\" target=\"_blank\"> lowest reported Iranian one is 8,000</a>.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">These details sound arcane, but the takeaway is simple: the devil really isn\'t in the detail. Even if we crudely split the difference, and assume a 6,000-centrifuge compromise, then we still end up with a 10-month breakout time. Iranian breakout would be detected within days, leaving ample time for a diplomatic and military response. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Israel\'s insistence that this would leave Iran at the \"nuclear threshold\" is simply not credible. And it is hard to understand why an extra two months would make much difference - and equally important to remember that an obsession with centrifuge numbers can come at the expense of attention to <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://nationalinterest.org/feature/who-cares-about-iranian-nuclear-breakout-beware-atomic-sneak-11604\" target=\"_blank\">covert routes to the bomb</a>, which can only be closed off through broad, intrusive inspections. </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Politically toxic step</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The real challenge here is that Iran must commit to the politically toxic step of dismantling thousands of its machines, because merely disconnecting some piping, or locking them in a cupboard, doesn\'t really buy you much time. But even if we had allowed Iran to keep all its operating centrifuges, this problem would still have come up, given its plethora of inactive but installed machines. It\'s up to Iran whether it chooses to emphasise the dismantling, or the fact that it gets to keep thousands of centrifuges - this will shape whether it can sell a deal at home.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Centrifuges aside, the issue of sanctions relief is proving to be particularly thorny. The US is offering the release of blocked funds and temporary sanctions waivers, with more permanent sanctions relief - requiring the approval of an intransigent Congress - further down the line. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Iran is understandably wary of limited and reversible measures, not least because the economic benefits are one of its primary motives for negotiating a deal in the first place. But assuming that these and other differences are bridged, what will be its regional implications?</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">A deal is <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/11/us-new-friend-region-iran-20141191344125636.html\" target=\"_blank\">not the same thing as rapprochement</a>. The US\' regional allies - Gulf states, Israel, and Turkey - all fear that a deal might prompt further US-Iran alignment at their expense. A letter from Obama to Ayatollah Khamenei, reportedly implying that a deal would enable cooperation against ISIL, as well as <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://m.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/11/16/remarks-president-obama-g20-press-conference-november-16-2014\" target=\"_blank\">Obama\'s explicit admission</a> that he wants a \"political conversation\" on Syria to include Iran. Last month, the US envoy to the anti-ISIL coalition acknowledged that \"we have welcomed Iran\'s constructive role in Iraq\", and \"we are going to continue to listen very carefully to the things they have to say\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">At the same time, Obama knows that sudden, overt collaboration with Iran would cause Arab allies to peel away from his military coalition in Syria, and complicate efforts to stand up armed Sunni forces in ISIL-afflicted parts of Iraq. Moreover, any meaningful US-Iran dialogue is premised on the US talking directly to Iran\'s Revolutionary Guards, who oversee Iran\'s extensive interventions in Syria and Iraq, or the Supreme Leader handing over the portfolio to Iran\'s more pragmatic foreign ministry. Neither scenario seems especially likely, and so the idea of US-Iran cooperation - whether one fears of welcomes it - is likely to outstrip the reality, in the months after any deal.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The reverse, however, is more worrying: if diplomacy collapses, the negotiating window slides shut, and Iran\'s nuclear programme starts re-expanding, the prospect of an Israeli or US war comes back into the picture, except this time both Tehran and Washington are already committed to open-ended campaigns, on multiple fronts, and, in Iraq, against the same adversary. </span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Shashank Joshi is a research fellow of the Royal United Services Institute in London and a PhD candidate at Harvard University.

got this, Bob Geldof, so back off\'','As Western stars re-release 1980s charity hit, many Africans say it\'s a demeaning relic that can do more harm than good.','<p>Bob Geldof may well be the only writer of one of the best-known songs of all time to admit that his multi-million selling anthem is truly awful and that he now finds himself irritated when he hears it on the radio.</p>\r\n<p>\"I am responsible for two of the worst songs in history,\" the shouty Irish singer and activist <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1333921/Do-They-Know-Its-Christmas-worst-song-world-admits-Bob-Geldof.html\" target=\"_blank\">said in 2010</a>. \"One is \'Do They Know It\'s Christmas?\' and the other one is \'We Are The World\'.\"</p>\r\n<p>But that hasn\'t stopped him <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w7jyVHocTk\" target=\"_blank\">re-recording the former</a>, originally released in 1984 to raise funds to fight to the Ethiopia famine, and now incongruously synonymous with Christmas in Britain. </p>\r\n<p>The problem is that a lot of people agree with his assessment, and many of them are from countries on the very continent he is trying to help.</p>\r\n<p>The original campaign, and similar well-meaning Western efforts, have led to an image of an Africa full of countries, and people, unable to help themselves and constantly looking to foreigners for help. </p>\r\n<p>When it was announced last week that, in response to Ebola, Geldof was planning to record a song he thinks is terrible for the fourth time, there was an eruption of criticism from Africans on Twitter and elsewhere.  </p>\r\n<p>Though the original was recorded to raise money for Ethiopia, African critics say the stigma its simplistic message left behind affected not only that country, but a continent of 54 hugely-varied nations.</p>\r\n<p>Detractors say an unintended legacy hinders investment, hurts tourism and inspires the sort of aid that has a negative impact.</p>\r\n<p>There are, of course, also Africans who have no problem with it - any initiative that raises money to respond to an underfunded disaster is welcome, they say. Questions about dignity can be debated later. The money raised by One Direction, Coldplay, Bono, Ed Sheeran and others is as welcome as anybody else\'s. </p>\r\n<p>But, with the power of celebrity hogging the media coverage, critical voices from the continent itself can often find themselves drowned out. So we spoke to them to find out why they don\'t want this sort of help. </p>\r\n<p>The first question we asked, with tongue firmly in cheek, was the one Geldof has wondered aloud through the power of song several times over the last 30 years: Whether or not they know of a thing called Christmas?</p>\r\n<p>These are their responses.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"></span></p>\r\n<h3>Abdullahi Halakhe, 33, policy analyst, Kenya</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><STRONG><i>Do you know it\'s Christmas?  </i></STRONG></span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>According to some estimates, the Christian population in Nigeria alone is almost three times the number of Christians in England and Wales. How couldn\'t they know it’s Christmas? Bishop Arinze from Nigeria was at one point even in the running to be the next Pope.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><!--<DATA_FIELDS>page_link,image_src,image_caption</DATA_FIELDS>--></div>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<div><!--<DATA_FIELDS>page_link,image_src,image_caption</DATA_FIELDS>--></div>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Just sample the grotesque tone of the lyrics, dripping with the \"White Man\'s Burden.\" It was awful 30 years ago, and it\'s awful today. If they wanted a spike in record sales because we are nearing Christmas, this was not a great move. </p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><STRONG><i>What do you think of Western charity songs like this as a response to African emergencies? </i></STRONG></span></p>\r\n<p>I think the fundamental problem with the \"saving\" Africa posture is that it is predicated on the notion that Africa/Africans are agency-less, which for me is problematic because it is the continuation of never-ending paternalistic tendencies towards Africa.</p>\r\n<p>Also, the idea that Africa needs to be saved in 2014 by washed up C-list pop artists is a perverse example of a messiah complex.</p>\r\n<p>For instance, Nigeria and Senegal had outbreaks of Ebola, and they dealt with them effectively. DR Congo has had a couple of Ebola outbreaks, and they\'ve dealt with them. But this is hardly mentioned in the hysteria-fuelled reportage about Ebola. Don\'t get me wrong; in the three worst affected countries the impact of Ebola has been devastating. But I\'d be hard pressed to think a Geldof-led charity song is the way to address it.</p>\r\n<h3><STRONG><i><span>Robtel Neajai Pailey</span>, 32, PhD researcher, Liberia </i></STRONG></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><STRONG><i>Do you know it\'s Christmas? </i></STRONG></span></p>\r\n<p>I was two years old when this phrase actually signified something. It baffles me that this old relic is being conjured up again in the 21st century. It was offensive then, and it remains offensive now. It would be best to leave it where it belongs: in the dustbins of history. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><STRONG><i><STRONG><i>What do you think of Western charity songs like this as a response to African emergencies?</i></STRONG></i></STRONG></span></p>\r\n<p>Western charity songs like the one being proposed by Geldof are not only patronising, they\'re redundant and unoriginal. Producing an Ebola song now to raise money, nearly one year after the first reported case in Guinea, is belated at best. It reeks of the \"white saviour complex\" because it negates local efforts that have come before it.</p>\r\n<p>Ebola-related songs have already been written and produced by African artists themselves, so what\'s the point of reinventing the wheel?</p>\r\n<p>In May, Liberian musicians Samuel \'Shadow\' Morgan and Edwin \'D-12\' Tweh wrote and produced \'<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0EBQKdQyyM\" target=\"_blank\">Ebola in Town</a>\'. The lyrics were informative and the percussive beats so hot that it became an immediate hit.</p>\r\n<p>And just last month, the song \'<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruYQY6z3mV8\" target=\"_blank\">Africa Stop Ebola</a>\' was produced by Malian, Ivorian, Congolese, and Guinean musicians. </p>\r\n<p>We got this, Geldof, so back off. If you really want to help, buy a gazillion CDs of the two songs and send them to your friends as stocking stuffers with a note that says: \"African solutions to African problems\". Instead of trying to remain relevant, Geldof and co. would do well to acknowledge the ingenuity of local artists and stop trying to steal the limelight!</p>\r\n<h3><STRONG><i>Dawit Gebreselassie, 26, financial analyst, Ethiopia   </i></STRONG></h3>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">Do you know it’s Christmas? </span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>I would ask does Geldof know when it\'s Christmas time in Ethiopia? As perhaps the fact that we celebrate Christmas a few weeks later on the 7th of January could have misled him into thinking we don\'t know when it is. Reassure him from us that, after his last three reminders, we are well aware and don\'t need any more prompting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><STRONG><i><STRONG><i>What do you think of Western charity songs like this as a response to African emergencies? </i></STRONG></i></STRONG></span></p>\r\n<p>I think such celebrity-led initiatives have come to do more harm than the \"good\" they were intended for. And, even worse, is that it\'s hard to imagine that the people behind it do not see the harm they are doing. </p>\r\n<p>Ethiopia has for the last few years been trying extremely hard to change its image as a poster child for poverty. It has been trying to depict a new bright image to the world so as to attract tourists and foreign direct investment. But this uphill battle is always hindered when such reminders of the past appear again on the screens of the people that are trying to be persuaded.  </p>\r\n<p>Africa\'s only hope of success against poverty is through sustained, structured and equitable economic growth brought about through things such as investment and tourism. It\'s hard to imagine how a few dollars raised every so often can possibly outweigh the damage it does by blemishing the continent\'s image.</p>\r\n<h3>Hadiyya Mwapachu, 30, student, Tanzania</h3>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">Do you know it\'s Christmas? </span></i></STRONG><br /><br /><span>Christmas coincides with the high tourist season. If you travel during this period within Tanzania, the pilot will clamour to present the best views of Mount Kilimanjaro\'s snow-capped peaks. This sight must be bewildering to everyone who knows the lyric: \"And there won\'t be snow in Africa this Christmas time\".  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Geldof said the lyrics will be changed for the current version. Will the revisions account for how the holiday\'s </span><span>commercialism also exists within the continent, albeit with far less spectacle? The image of Africans buying each other presents and celebrating with large spreads of food directly contradicts the ultimate gift of all, that of aid being brought in by the wisemen.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">What do you think of Western charity songs like this as a response to African emergencies? </span></i></STRONG><br /><br /><span>The oft-quoted observation by Marx that \"history repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce\" applies here for both its acuteness and how it has become a cliche. The Band Aid songs reflect this pattern. They begin as an attempt to respond to catastrophe and then excise all historical context and specificity. </span><br /><br /><span>The meaning that remains is that one should help as \"well tonight, thank God it\'s them instead of you\". This erases the history of state actions in fostering armed conflict and the deliberate displacement of civilians. The 1984 and 1989 Ethiopia famine relief editions did not recognise this history. The genocide in South Sudan was also absent in the 2004 version to raise money for Darfur.  </span><br /><br /><span>So you have messages that are interchangeable, where each emergency is met with lyrics that already fit. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Western complicity within global relations of power is also unmentioned. There is a movement underway in Guinea that uses popular culture, traditional art forms and the radio to deconstruct stigma and raise awareness about Ebola. There are similar projects in Liberia and Nigeria. These efforts are the transformative ones. </span></p>\r\n<h3><STRONG><i>Chitra Nagarajan, 31, human rights activist, Nigeria </i></STRONG></h3>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">Do you know it\'s Christmas?  </span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>Well, self-important celebrities are getting together to do a charity single latching on to the issue of the day to raise money for \"those poor people over there\" so I guess it must be. But given everyone I know is thinking and talking about politics and forthcoming elections in Nigeria, or the latest fight on Twitter, Christmas seems very far away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">What do you think of Western charity songs like this as a response to African emergencies?   </span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>It\'s yet another classic sign of white Western saviourism, in this case with celebrities swooping in to \"save\" the people of Africa. Not only does this take away the agency of people living in African countries who are the ones who actually lead and make change happen, but it perpetuates stereotypes of conflict, poverty and disease as the single story of the continent.</p>\r\n<p>This is likely to exacerbate the discrimination of Africans as potential Ebola-carriers that we have already seen. It is also a manifestation of increasing celebritisation whereby every possible topic has a famous musician or actor attached who become \"experts\" listened to at the expense of the actual people whose lives are affected. Darfur has George Clooney. Ending poverty has Bono. Now Ebola has Bob Geldof. Research shows that it\'s the celebrities and their image not the causes that benefit the most.</p>\r\n<p>If the purpose of Bob Geldof and others is really to help the Ebola response rather than burnish their own profiles as modern day saints, they would donate money behind the scenes. The money that will be raised through this Ebola single could easily be raised by these rich musicians having a whip round among themselves and their friends.</p>\r\n<h3><STRONG><i>Patrick Bond, 52, economist, South Africa </i></STRONG></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><STRONG><i>Do you know it\'s Christmas? </i></STRONG></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes.

Vojislav Seselj, leader of the former ultra-right-wing Serbian Radical Party, came back home after spending more than 11 years in the detention unit of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv1210111920msonormal\"><span>The Tribunal based in The Hague announced that Seselj was conditionally released for humanitarian reasons before getting a sentence; he is to be treated for metastasised colon cancer. No Tribunal official has been able to say when they would be handing down a sentence; the most optimistic estimation (by outsiders) has been 2016. The ICTY is at risk of having yet another defendant die before being sentenced when its credibility is at an all-time low. Not even those who enthusiastically supported it in the past believe today in its ability to bring justice for war crimes. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv1210111920msonormal\"><span>Back in 2003 before he flew to The Hague, Seselj announced he was going there to destroy \"that anti-Serbian political institution\". And he succeeded. Many Serbians, even those who do not lean right, see him as someone who came home a winner, as the man who brought the Tribunal down to its knees. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv1210111920msonormal\"><span>And as officials in The Hague contemplate the future of the ICTY, Serbia will have to deal with <span>the resurrection of Seselj which</span> threatens to stir simmering tensions within a society tired of endless transition. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv1210111920msonormal\"><STRONG><i>Seselj\'s revenge</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv1210111920msonormal\"><span>Back in 2003, current Serbian <span>President Tomislav Nikolic and </span>Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic saw off Seselj on his way to The Hague with tears. B<span>ack in the 1990s t</span>hey were both close associates of Seselj - the number two and number three in the Serbian Radical Party, one of the largest political parties in Serbia at that time. When Seselj went to the ICTY, Nikolic assumed the leadership of the party.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class=\"yiv1210111920msonormal\"><span>As members of parliament, Nikolic and Vucic wore Seselj\'s image pinned on their lapels, promoted his ideas of a Greater Serbia and declared all steps taken by Serbia towards Euro-Atlantic integration betrayal.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv1210111920msonormal\"><span>In 2008, the two of them, along with 20 other radicals, abandoned the ultranationalist cause. They formed the new Serbian Progressive Party and made an ideological u-turn. Their party now supports cooperation with the US, rapprochement with Western Europe, and EU accession. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv1210111920msonormal\"><span>But unlike other countries from the region which negotiated their way into the EU, Serbia\'s accession path is complicated by tough demands from the EU, including normalisation of relations with Kosovo, and renunciation of Serbia\'s \"neutral foreign policy\" on the Ukraine issue and introduction of sanctions towards Russia. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv1210111920msonormal\"><span>The Serbian government conceeded to signing an agreement on the normalisation of relations with Kosovo which was negotiated and signed in Brussels under the auspices of the EU. This move was not well-received by nationalists.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv1210111920msonormal\">One of the first statements Seselj made after stepping on Serbian soil was that he is now seeking \"revenge\" against all those who had betrayed him - an uncanny reference to Vucic and Nikolic. He went on to call for establishing a close alliance with Russia (even suggesting what he called \"<a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://web-tribune.com/tema_dana/seseljev-intervju-za-glas-rusije-nasa-sansa-i-jedini-spas-je-potpuna-integracija-sa-rusijom#\" target=\"_blank\">integration</a>\") and abandoning the negotiations for accession to the EU and any cooperation with western countries</p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv1210111920msonormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">During the welcoming rally for Seselj in the centre of Belgrade, the media, under the influence of the ruling party, only took pictures of older, unkempt and bearded ultranationalists who looked like extras from an old movie. The media tried to ignore the presence of young men and women who were only children when Seselj went to The Hague.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv1210111920msonormal\"><span>These young people might not remember the politics of the 1990s, but they are disappointed and bitter about their lives in the 2010s. They cannot see a tangible benefit from Serbia\'s re-orientation towards Europe and Nato. They are young, angry and in need of a charismatic figure to worship. Seselj could be the catalyst to ignite their discontent and lead them to become a strong factor in Serbian politics. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv1210111920msonormal\"><span>We no longer have citizens in Serbia, Ratko Bozovic, a sociologist and professor tells me; we have only \"partocrats\". People go from one party to another without paying any attention to ideas; they just go with those in power. With the reduction in salaries and retirement compensations </span><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">which will take place before Christmas, there will be further citizenship attrition. Bozovic says that if Seselj\'s health does not fail him, he is well-positioned to win many more followers for the ultra-right cause in Serbia.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv1210111920msonormal\"><span>Vucic and Nikolic are well aware that they have limited space for manoeuvre in complying with western demands.  In the weeks leading up to Seselj\'s return, Belgrade hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin for a short visit, welcoming him with a military parade and decorating him with the Order of the Republic of Serbia. While Seselj was welcomed at the airport, Russian and Serbian troops conducted a joint military exercises in the north of Serbia. Clearly, Vucic and Nikolic cannot risk giving Seselj more political capital for his revenge. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv1210111920msonormal\"><span>Were it not for this geostrategic labyrinth and an EU accession process made too slow and difficult, Seselj\'s return to the immature political scene in Serbia would have not created so much confusion. Had The Hague Tribunal efficiently and impartially done its job and justly sentenced or acquit those suspected of war crimes, Seselj and his rhetoric would have been forgotten. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv1210111920msonormal\"><span>With the current geopolitical circumstances, Seselj\'s presence on Serbian soil will only create more tension and instability and will be a constant reminder of our war-torn past.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv1210111920msonormal\"><em style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><STRONG><i>Zorana Suvakovic is a Belgrade-based journalist, columnist and editor, working for the Serbian newspaper Politika.</i></STRONG></em></p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/images/2014/11/17//20141117101616886734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/images/2014/11/17/20141117101616886734_20.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-19 00:51:37','Al Jazeera',0.00000000,0.00000000,NULL,NULL),(450,'20141116114613645536','http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/11/kaliningrad-last-wall-europe-20141116114613645536.html','Kaliningrad: The last wall in Europe','The current turmoil between Europe and Russia is most felt in a narrow piece of land between Poland and Lithuania.','<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">On November 16, Vladimir Putin decided to abruptly leave the G20 Summit in Brisbane, underlining the deepening of the rift between Russia and other world powers. The contrast with recent joint celebrations of World War II armistice gathering Putin and western heads of state, or with Gorbachev\'s presence at the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall last week, is striking. The confrontation between a liberal Europe and a centralised Russia once torn to pieces 25 years ago seems to have reached a new level. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Indeed, at the very same time commemorations of the fall of the Berlin wall <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">peaked </span>last week, the rumbling of military boots continued to shed a troubling light over the civil conflict in Ukraine. Even after the signing of the <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/russias-putin-ukraines-poroshenko-end-summit-with-no-breakthrough-on-conflict/2014/10/17/f12d55c8-5604-11e4-b86d-184ac281388d_story.html\" target=\"_blank\">Minsk ceasefire protocol</a> last September, fighting never totally stopped in Donetsk and the number of casualties in fights between local military groups supported by the former Cold War foes kept rising. While in Berlin, some rejoiced over the end of the Cold War last century, others in Mariupol, Luhansk or Kiev fear its return today.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">On the one hand, Putin is able to make a convincing case that Crimea and the Eastern Ukrainian Republics should be <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/17/vladimir-putin-denies-russian-forces-eastern-ukraine-kiev\" target=\"_blank\">attached to Russia on historical grounds</a>, often referring to \"Novorossiya\", the 19th century denomination of a Russian Tsar-controlled territory that spread beyond Odessa in Ukraine.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Russian sovereignty</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">However, the very same logic can be used to challenge the Russian sovereignty over territories in the Pacific and Europe, from the Japanese claimed Kuril Islands to western Karelia, which most in Finland claim has been illegally occupied by Russia since 1939. The same argumentation fuels a decades long dispute with China over the north bank of Russia\'s Far Eastern Amur River.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Last week\'s events have not been followed more closely than in Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave within Europe, a narrow piece of land between Poland and Lithuania, where this contradiction is felt every day. This small territory, home to half a million inhabitants, has for centuries been under Prussian and later German control before being seized by Stalin in the last months of World War II. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Before its takeover by Russia, Koenigsberg - as it was then called - was an important industrial and trade asset for Germany but also an essential German intellectual and cultural centre, known for being the birthplace of Immanuel Kant and the residence of Hannah Arendt and poets such as Simon Dach and Agnes Miegel. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Putin can hardly argue that the Russian sovereignty over Kaliningrad/Koenigsberg is naturally derived from cultural and historical legitimacy. Immanuel Kant is one of the main father figures of the very European liberalism that Moscow rejects today. The political philosophy Kant theorised is based on two main principles: a republican government and a liberal participation in international organisation, which both are antithetic to Putin\'s administration and strategy.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Interestingly, Kaliningrad is home today to a large Ukrainian community, the descendants of populations from Kiev or Donetsk encouraged to settle in the oblast under Stalin after the Germans were expelled. Despite constant attempts to silence the territories\' cultural traditions, the permanence of Prussian ruins next to the Soviet-inspired architecture and the vicinity of European countries have led to the <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/if-russia-gets-crimea-should-germany-get-kaliningrad/496558.html\" target=\"_blank\">creation a mixed society</a>, both russophone and proud of its heritage as the former Prussian capital in the 1500s and 1600s. In the dispute over the denomination of the territory (Kaliningrad or Koenigsberg), its inhabitant have opted either for \"Konig\" or \"Kant\'grad\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Direct consequences</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The current turmoil between Europe and Russia has had direct consequences for Kant\'grad. An agreement signed in 2012 which allowed the inhabitants to cross into Poland for their daily groceries or consumption goods purchases without visa could be affected by the ramping up of European sanctions.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Similarly, the territory has become very vulnerable following the <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://rbth.com/business/2014/09/04/vulnerable_kaliningrad_finding_its_way_past_food_embargo_despite_pro_39561.html\" target=\"_blank\">food embargo </a>imposed by Putin in August. The population now fears an increase in prices for daily commodities - and ongoing tensions in Ukraine and the isolation of Russia internationally should not alleviate their worries.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">To compensate for the rising concerns over unemployment and inflation, the Kremlin opened its wallet despite its own economic turmoil. To break with the isolation, the Kremlin announced the construction of a $224 million port infrastructure in the seaport of Kaliningrad. Economic incentives and support from Moscow fall short however. In an essay <a href=\"http://www.stoletie.ru/rossiya_i_mir/krym_prishol_a_kaliningrad_uhodit_799.htm\" target=\"_blank\">published in Stoleti.ru</a>, Vladimir Shulgin, a professor at the Baltic Federal University underlined the slow drift of Kaliningrad away from Russian nationalism and towards a more liberal and European identity. This tribune led to his expulsion from a university in which he had worked over 30 years. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Yet the slow increase of support to nationalist movements in Kaliningrad cannot be denied. If the strength of separatist movements in Kaliningrad is often exaggerated and their structuration weak, some parties do gain traction such as the Baltic Republican Party.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">As Vladimir Titov - a Moscow based commentator - argues, \"<a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://rufabula.com/articles/2014/08/13/from-siberia-to-the-amber-country\" target=\"_blank\">regionalism as a political direction has real prospects</a>\" in Kaliningrad, which clearly diverges from the centralisation of power in Moscow. While the Kremlin was very swift and determined to regain control over Crimea (and the Russian Black Sea fleet in Sevastopol), it will eventually have to face the growing discontentment and normative drift of its population in a faraway exclave, home to its Baltic Fleet. And this time the historical legitimacy will work against him.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Remi Piet is Assistant Professor of Public Policy, Diplomacy and International Political Economy at Qatar University.</span></i></STRONG></em></p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/images/2014/11/16//2014111612256276734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/images/2014/11/16/2014111612256276734_20.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-19 00:46:57','Remi Piet',55.75582600,37.61730000,NULL,NULL),(451,'2014111462055525220','http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/oman-considers-life-after-qaboos-2014111462055525220.html','Oman considers life after Qaboos','Long-time leader, who has been receiving medical treatment, will miss national day celebrations for the first time.','<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">For the first time since he took power more than four decades ago, Oman’s Sultan Qaboos bin Said al-Said will not attend the country’s national day celebrations.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Known as Sultan Qaboos, the Omani leader has been receiving medical treatment in Germany for an unconfirmed illness since summer.

After seizing power, Qaboos appointed himself prime minister, defence minister, finance minister and foreign affairs minister, and commander of the armed forces.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Qaboos is credited with modernising the country’s economy, and instituting cultural and educational reforms. Under Qaboos, Oman was transformed into a modest, yet important, regional player capable of bridging major diplomatic divides, as seen in its role as mediator in nuclear talks between Iran and the United States.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In the capital Muscat, a major street, the port and university are named after Qaboos, and his photo can be seen affixed to major landmarks and in hotels, shop windows and restaurants around the city.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">“More than the technical [advances] and modernisation, I think the most important achievement of the sultan has been to create a very strong Omani national identity,” explained Marc Valeri, professor of political economy of the Middle East at the University of Exeter, and an expert on Oman.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">He explained that without a charismatic leader like Qaboos leading the country, already-existing problems – from high unemployment and economic woes to Oman’s delicate role in regional affairs – could serve as major stumbling blocks. “All these things will be tremendous for the next Sultan.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Another issue is one of legitimacy. “Obviously the new ruler will not have the same legitimacy as Sultan Qaboos.

The party will either opt for an inclusive coalition that includes Ennahda or drift towards a government with smaller parties, leaving Ennahda in opposition.</p>\r\n<p>Despite all the posturing to the contrary, the raison d’être of Nidaa Tounes - which was founded by left-wing politicians, secularists and former government officials in 2012 - is to provide a counterweight to the rise of Ennahda.</p>\r\n<p>Consequently, any political alliance with Ennahda could turn self-destructive for Nidaa Tounes, invalidating the party\'s strategy of discrediting the Islamist party.</p>\r\n<p>Allani says that whichever way the political manoeuvring goes, it will be based on three possible scenarios.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\"The first scenario is the formation of a national unity government as demanded by Ennahda. This scenario is not popular among Nidaa Tounes and its allies. Therefore it will be rejected,\" he said.</p>\r\n<p>\"The second scenario is having a technocratic government headed by a figure from Nidaa Tounes, and this possibility is also unlikely as many political parties reject this option.</p>\r\n<p>\"The most likely option is a government composed of two-thirds technocrats and one-third politicians, with the option of granting minor ministerial posts to Ennahda,\" Allani said, noting Essebsi will try to get some support from Ennahda, but he needs to offer something in return.</p>\r\n<p>Nidaa Tounes could also opt to exclude Ennahda and form a coalition government with other smaller parties, but the political debates that flood Tunisian media outlets are mostly against this option.</p>\r\n<p>The majority of political analysts in Tunisia believe the disadvantages of this option far outweigh its advantages, making it a much less desirable choice to meet the challenges the country is facing. They argue that Ennahda remains a significant force in the country and its role is crucial for any future decision-making.</p>\r\n<p>There are also concerns that the distribution of power among scores of political parties would further splinter Tunisian society.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, small parties may exercise no power in the ruling coalition, in that larger partners could use their leverage to wring concessions from them, leading to the emergence of a new authoritarian style of government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"If Essebsi wins the presidency, all executive powers will be shared by him and his party that enjoys a majority in the parliament and which will nominate a candidate for the prime minister\'s office. This can become a source of worry. Yet, the party cannot and will not be able to govern by itself,\" Aziz Krichan, a former adviser to President Moncef Marzouki, told Al Jazeera.</p>\r\n<p>\"The issue then is not about who to include in the coalition government, but on the basis of what. Unfortunately, all political parties are giving the impression of difference despite the underlying sameness. New bloods should be streamed into the Tunisian political life. All current parties are running out of genuine solutions to the country’s pressing issues and challenges. They all somehow copied and pasted the programmes of Ben Ali’s governments.</p>\r\n<p>\"Tunisia needs new democratic powers, unlike Nidaa or Ennahda. Tunisia is in need of a new national agenda that should focus in the coming five years on how to maintain security, improve economy and complete the democratic transition of the country,\" Krichan added.</p>\r\n<p>Western countries support the idea of Nidaa Touness and Ennahda collaborating to form a national unity government, bringing in some of the smaller parties as well, while some regional Arab powers differ on the option of including or excluding Ennahda.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\"Certain Gulf countries won\'t invest a penny in Tunisia if Ennahda is given a bigger role in the coming government. Even rich neighbouring Algeria has reservations,\" Allani said. \"European countries do not invest much in Tunisia because they are going through a crisis of their own and they are also looking into securing deals with Gulf countries. So for Tunisians to get the Gulf funds, they need to do their calculations right.\"</p>\r\n<p>Most Tunisians agree that the formation of any coalition requires all stakeholders to adapt to the new challenges of multiparty government, as fragmentation of political support could lead to a fragile coalition and consequently to political paralysis amid squabbles between the parties over policy issues.</p>\r\n<p>\"Any well-trodden path towards democracy has to accommodate dialogue and consensus through consultation and coexistence rather than unilateralism and self-interest,\" Krichan said. \"That is the only way out to achieve win-win results.\"</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><em>Hend Hassassi has contributed reporting to this piece.</em></i></STRONG></p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/18/201411181161714734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/Images/2014/11/18/201411181161714734_20.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-19 00:06:14','Ahmed El Amraoui',0.00000000,0.00000000,NULL,NULL),(453,'20141118124815397810','http://www.aljazeera.com/sport/basketball/2014/11/butler-guides-bulls-past-clippers-20141118124815397810.html','Butler guides Bulls past the Clippers','Guard Jimmy Butler scores 22 points as Chicago Bulls win sixth straight game on the road and snap losing run vs LA.','<p>Guard Jimmy Butler scored 22 points and forward Taj Gibson added 20 as the Chicago Bulls defeated the Los Angeles Clippers 105-89.</p>\r\n<p>Despite playing without the injured Pau Gasol (left calf strain) and point guard Derrick Rose (hamstring), Chicago (8-3) dictated in the second half and snapped a four-game losing streak to Los Angeles (5-4) to be 6-0 on the road this season.</p>\r\n<p>Elsewhere, the Memphis Grizzlies emphatically defended their home court at FedExForum with a 119-93 victory over the Houston Rockets in a battle of the top teams in the West.</p>\r\n<p>Memphis (10-1) led by as many as 36 points in the fourth quarter and finished with its largest margin of victory this season.</p>\r\n<p>Houston (9-2) never pulled closer than 20 points after halftime.</p>\r\n<p>Arron Afflalo had a season-high 23 points, guard Ty Lawson had 24 points and 12 assists and the Denver Nuggets ended the Cleveland Cavaliers\' four-game winning streak with a 106-97 victory on the road.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Other results:</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>Mavericks 107, Hornets 80</p>\r\n<p>Magic 107, Pistons 93</p>\r\n<p>Suns 118, Celtics 114</p>\r\n<p>Heat 95, Nets 83</p>\r\n<p>Spurs 100, 76ers 75</p>\r\n<p>Trail Blazers 102, Pelicans 93</p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/images/2014/11/18//20141118125837370734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/images/2014/11/18/20141118125837370734_20.jpg',NULL,'Reuters','2014-11-19 00:01:21','Al Jazeera',0.00000000,0.00000000,NULL,NULL),(454,'20141118122552701339','http://www.aljazeera.com/video/middleeast/2014/11/iraqi-forces-battle-strategic-town-20141118122552701339.html','Iraqi forces in battle for strategic town','Ameriya, in Anbar, a top priority for military as its fall would give ISIL fighters access to Baghdad\'s main airport.','<p>Iraqi government forces are fighters a crucial battle to stop ISIL fighters from reaching the strategic town of Ameriya in Anbar province.

But he wonders how much we really see the great structures surrounding us as we move through our modern spaces.</p>\r\n<p>For three years, he has been a time lapse photographer, patiently turning his camera on some special buildings and encouraging us to consider what they reveal of our past, present and future.</p>\r\n<p>In Metropolis, Richard uses his photography to explore our relationships with the cities and structures that surround us.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i> From the correspondent: </i></STRONG></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p> \"When I was about eight or nine my dad got a 16mm cinecamera. It was a wind up one that we would take on family holidays. I remember using it to take some stock frame animation of my Spiderman action figure as I made him climb up the trellis in our back garden. There was always something visual about my play as a child and I think that\'s where my interest in photography began.</p>\r\n<p>Then, in my work, I\'ve spent years travelling around the world - going everywhere from Swaziland to Sweden, Denmark to Dubai - helping journalists, reporters and filmmakers use highly technical equipment to create visually stunning films. It\'s a lifestyle that involves living in hotels and travelling around new cities on my own - taking trains, taxis and buses. I\'m always finding myself surrounded by great architecture. We are often oblivious to our urban environment, and while I\'m sometimes guilty of walking around staring at my phone, time lapse photography has taught me to be more present in the moment; to just stop and appreciate the buildings around me.</p>\r\n<p>A lot of people ask why I don\'t just shoot video and speed it up. But time lapse is a beautiful combination of still photography and videography. You have to compose the shot correctly. You have to drag the shutter by just the right amount. You have to work out what the best interval is going to be - are the clouds moving slowly or are they flying through the sky? You basically have to decide exactly what it is that you are trying to achieve. It is so much more than just running video for 30 minutes and then speeding it up. It\'s more creative, technical and demanding - not only on the mind but physically.</p>\r\n<p>I do it, first and foremost, to show the rest of the world, and the time lapse community in particular, where I\'ve been and what I\'ve been able to create; to ask them \'do you like it too?\' There\'s an immediacy to the feedback when you upload something to a site like Vimeo. Everybody is so willing to share their ideas and experiences.</p>\r\n<p>I also think that, deep down, all of us want to become experts at something. Time lapse photography has given me the chance to immerse my heart and soul into a passion that lets me take myself and the viewers on a journey.</p>\r\n<p>But in making this film, I\'ve learnt that cities are more than just buildings. They are more than infrastructure; more than the monorail, the cars and taxis, the petrol station and the fast food place on the corner. What brings all cities to life is the people who live in them. When you are part of those communities, even if just for a short time, you take something of it with you. You take it on to the next place you visit. And like this you are able to understand people, cultures and the struggles that unite so many of us.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><STRONG><i><br /></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><br /></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><br /></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><br /></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Metropolis in pictures: </i></STRONG><em>(click to view gallery)</em></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nAl Jazeera Correspondent can be seen each week at the following times GMT: Thursday: 2000; Friday: 1200; Saturday: 0100; Sunday: 0600; Monday: 2000; Tuesday: 1200; Wednesday: 0100; Thursday: 0600. <br />\r\n<p><a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://english.aljazeera.net/programmes/aljazeeracorrespondent/\"> Watch more Al Jazeera Correspondent  </a></p>\r\n<div></div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/13/2014111311234631734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/Images/2014/11/13/2014111311234631734_20.jpg',NULL,NULL,'2014-11-18 23:39:56','Al Jazeera',0.00000000,0.00000000,NULL,NULL),(456,'2014111891742878303','http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/countingthecost/2014/11/dr-carlos-lopes-ebola-economic-impact-2014111891742878303.html','Dr Carlos Lopes: Ebola\'s economic impact','The executive secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa discusses a new UNECA report on Ebola.','<p>While the Ebola outbreaks in both Nigeria and Senegal officially ended in October 2014, a new United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (<span>UNECA) </span>report says there have been 13,241 cases identified and 4,950 deaths reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone so far. `</p>\r\n<p>The report notes the risk of a rise in mortality of diseases not related to Ebola and points out the wider impacts of the virus, like the educational system being shut down, social stigmas, rising unemployment, and decreased food security. </p>\r\n<p>However, Dr <span>Carlos </span>Lopes tells<em> Counting the Cost</em> that, while the social and economic situation in the three most affected countries is dramatic, the crisis for Africa is exaggerated.</p>\r\n<p>According to the report, West Africa has been the fastest growing region in Africa in recent years.

However, with bigger fires getting out of control in other parts of the world, it seems to have been relegated to the back page of mainstream media for most of the last few months. But what happens there in the near term and long term really does matter, both locally and regionally. The poorest country in the Middle East, Yemen has been plagued for decades by corrupt and weak governments, tribal infighting, resource depletion, a deteriorating security situation and utter poverty. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Two months ago, Houthi rebels riding a wave of public discontent, swarmed into the capital city of Sanaa from the north, and succeeded in bringing the regime to its knees in a matter of just days. In the eyes of many Yemenis, the Houthis are, at least for now, the dominant political force and best hope for change in a country that truly needs it from top to bottom. They are also a substantial military force, having taken control of much of Yemen\'s security apparatus in the north and central parts of the country. What makes both these points remarkable is that the Houthis are members of the Zaidi branch of Shia Islam, a small minority in an otherwise Sunni majority country. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Zaidis reigned over much of northern Yemen under a system of religious and secular rule known as an imamate for over a thousand years until revolution swept through the country in 1962. Yemen\'s nationalist movement eventually led to the establishment of two separate countries: the Yemen Arab Republic or North Yemen and the Peoples Democratic Republic of Yemen or South Yemen. In 1990, North and South Yemen united to become the present day Republic of Yemen. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Marginalised</i></STRONG> </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">However, the Zaidis never regained the power and influence they had prior to 1962, and have been both politically and economically marginalised by each successive government ever since - at least up until now. And that\'s an important point to remember in any discussion about the Houthis.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In 2004, <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29319423\" target=\"_blank\">Hussein Badr al Din al-Houthi</a>, a dissident cleric from northern Yemen and head of the Zaidi sect there, started an uprising against the government in Sanaa, demanding greater autonomy in the north, as well as to protect Zaidi religious and cultural traditions from perceived impingement by Sunnis. Houthi was killed by government troops just a few months later, but his followers adopted his name and carried on the struggle. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Following a series of on again off again periods of bloody fighting, the Houthis agreed to a ceasefire with the government in 2010. However, not much changed for the Houthis in terms of perceived grievances perpetuated by the government, which brings us to the more recent events that resulted in the Houthis\' rapid and astonishing rise to power. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">President Ali Abdullah Saleh ruled Yemen with an iron fist for more than 30 years, and although a Zaidi himself, was no ally of the Houthis. In fact, he was their nemesis during and after the six years of rebellion.   As the Arab Spring swept through much of the Middle East in 2011, the Houthis took advantage of growing dissatisfaction throughout Yemen with the Saleh government, and began to consolidate their control in the north. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">As part of the <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://carnegieendowment.org/syriaincrisis/?fa=57091\" target=\"_blank\">Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative</a> signed later that year, Saleh agreed to step down and pass the reigns of power to his deputy, Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi. But once again, promises of government reform went nowhere and the lives of everyday Yemenis, to include the Houthis, were no better. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">For the Houthis, the final straw in their clash with the government was the lifting of fuel subsidies in July 2014, which lead to wide scale protests by both Sunni and Shia in Sanaa. By that time, the Houthis had become much more politically astute and militarily capable. They knew what they wanted and how they were going to achieve it. After taking control of Sanaa in September, the Houthis forced Yemen\'s Prime Minister, Mohammed Basindwa, to resign, and then outright rejected Hadi\'s first nomination to replace him. From that point on, the Houthis have more or less been calling the shots in Sanaa, although it\'s important to note that what happens there doesn\'t necessarily carry weight in much of the rest of the country. </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Political concessions</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">So what do the Houthis want? The short answer is political concessions that give them significant influence in the central government and greater regional autonomy throughout the country, particularly for them in the north. And so far, they\'ve been very successful in that regard. Since taking control of security functions in and around Sana’a two months ago, the Houthis have proven to be a formidable military force, and have not shied away from flexing their muscle.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Frustrated with Hadi\'s slow pace toward reform, the Houthis gave him a 10-day ultimatum at the end of October to form a new government, which he subsequently announced on November 9. The new technocratic reconciliation government includes representatives from the traditional power bases as well as the Houthis, southern secessionists and most every other political party in the country. For now, the Houthis have established themselves as a legitimate political party with long-term goals, and an essential part of the security apparatus. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">So what stands in the way of the Houthis\' plans for greater influence in Yemeni politics? Plenty. In the south, the al-Hirak secessionist movement looks at the Houthis as a direct threat to their long sought after aim of independence, especially if the Houthis begin to move in that direction. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Consider also, the Islah Party, which is Yemen\'s branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, and the Houthis\' biggest political rival. Each will do what they can to undermine the other. And then of course there is al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), based primarily in central Yemen, where the Houthis have already begun to extend their influence. Daily clashes between the Houthis and AQAP are taking a deadly toll on both sides, with no sign of letting up. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">AQAP will forge whatever relations they can with the Sunni tribes in central Yemen to exploit in their favor the Sunni-Shia struggles seen throughout much of the Middle East. And speaking of Sunni-Shia struggles, don\'t discount Saudi Arabia either, which looks at the Houthis as nothing more than an Iranian tool to undermine them. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Houthis\' rise to power and influence was as sudden as it was unexpected, and for now at least, they have brought about political change that may not have occurred otherwise for many years. Change that for the first time in Yemen\'s history is set to be truly representative of all the disparate political factions. Only time will tell whether the new government can effectively control a country as complex and diverse as Yemen. But the Houthis\' best chance at helping it to succeed is to maintain their role as a legitimate long-term political party with limited goals and a short-term guarantor of security. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">What they don\'t want to do is become another divisive political or military element with a grand scheme for power and influence, something Yemen has proven to have no shortage of in the past. </span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Martin Reardon is a Senior Vice President with The Soufan Group, a New York-based strategic security and intelligence consultancy, and Senior Director of Qatar International Academy for Security Studies.

In the last few years, especially after Israel tightened its siege on Gaza following the 2007 takeover of the area by Hamas, tunnel-digging beneath Rafah has flourished. Smugglers bring into Gaza essential items such as medicine, food, construction materials and fuel.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The crackdown on tunnels is not new: In 2013, following the ouster of Egypt\'s first democratically elected President Mohammed Morsi, a Hamas patron, the Egyptian army moved against the tunnels.

the universe\'s oldest galaxies','Astronomers have captured images of primordial galaxies that helped light up the cosmos after the Big Bang.','<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Beijing, China</i></STRONG> - A global team of astronomers exploring the origins of the universe has captured images of ancient \"starburst\" galaxies that helped end the \"cosmic dark ages\" 13-billion years ago.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Using the world\'s most advanced orbiting telescope, Hubble Space Telescope, these scientists have discovered first-generation galaxies that lit up the heavens with pyrotechnics of massive stars following the Big Bang. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Analysing starlight from one faint galaxy - the most distant ever found - astrophysicists determined that its heavily red-shifted photons were nearly as old as the universe itself. Red-shift measures the changing colour or wavelength of light with the expansion of the cosmos and the passage of time.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">These ancient particles of light were emitted by a primordial grouping of stars that emerged some 150 million years after the Big Bang, explained Adi Zitrin, a Hubble scholar in astronomy at the California Institute of Technology who helped find and explore the features of the galaxy, named \"MACS0647-JD\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Looking back in time</i></STRONG></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Scientists were able to pinpoint the age of this early galaxy because of the structure of the cosmos and the properties of light, which together make the universe a massive optical time machine. By scanning the heavens to discover this galaxy, astronomers were also peering more than 100 million centuries back in time.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"We see more distant galaxies as they were in the distant past,\" said Dan Coe, an astrophysicist at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, who led the discovery.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">To photograph this array of stars, astronomers scattered across four continents - North America, Europe, Asia and South America - and relied primarily on cameras deployed inside the Hubble Space Telescope. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">From its position in orbit 500 kilometres above Earth, Hubble avoids the atmospheric distortions faced by ground-based telescopes, and can capture images of some of the most remote collections of stars in the cosmos.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Yet the discovery also relied on supermassive zoom lenses that are built into the structure of the universe. Clusters of galaxies can act as \"gravitational lenses\" that magnify and brighten background sources of light, including stars and galaxies such as MACS0647-JD. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">This phenomenon was predicted by Albert Einstein more than 100 years ago, while he was refining his theory on how massive bodies such as stars can curve the contours of space-time and deflect waves of light. Gravitational lensing is now being used by astronomers, including Zitrin\'s group, to peer ever farther across the cosmos and back in time, to the origins of the first galaxies. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">To find the MACS0647-JD galaxy, astronomers used the lens created by the cluster of galaxies called MACS J0647, which magnified and created three identical images of the background collection of stars, said Coe, an expert on gravitational lensing. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Over the past several years, astronomers including Coe and Zitrin have led the race to pinpoint the clusters that provide the most powerful gravitational lenses in order the find the earliest galaxies at the edges of the known universe. Aided by these cosmic lenses, said Coe, \"we have been closing in on the first galaxies\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Ancient galaxies</i></STRONG></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Another extremely faint galaxy from the young universe was recently discovered by Zitrin\'s group using a cosmic magnifying lens provided by \"Pandora\'s Cluster\", or Abell 2744.  Pandora\'s Cluster produced multiple images of the ancient background galaxy, which helped astrophysicists date its emergence to roughly 250 million years after the Big Bang, Zitrin explained.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Although it is tiny compared to the spiral expanses of the Milky Way, which is estimated to contain at least 200 billion stars, this ancient galaxy had a far higher star formation rate, or ability to produce new suns relative to its mass, Zitrin said. Both of the high-red-shift galaxies he helped uncover are \"representatives of the first generation of galaxies to have formed\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In these ancient, first-generation galaxies, Coe said, \"the first primordial stars may have been 100 times the mass of our sun. They burned bright and died young.\" </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The globe-spanning group of scientists includes several leading researchers based in China. Observation time with the Hubble Space Telescope, which is jointly operated by NASA and the European Space Agency, is open to astronomers around the world. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Finding new pieces in the puzzle of the first galaxies to illuminate the cosmos \"is truly a worldwide endeavour involving astronomers of multiple nationalities based around the globe\", said Jeremy Lim, a professor at the University of Hong Kong (HKU).</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">An astrophysicist at the prestigious University of Science and Technology of China, Xingxing Huang, said collaboration on the twin studies of ancient galaxies reflects the increasingly global nature of leading-edge discoveries in astronomy, and he forecast this trend will accelerate in the future.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Zitrin, meanwhile, predicted other massive gravitational lenses spread across the heavens, some of which are now being observed, will likely propel a new wave of discoveries of ancient, distant galaxies.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">He added these cosmic zoom lenses work in both directions.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">If there were an advanced civilisation in one of the ancient galaxies discovered, its astronomers could likewise use the same gravitational lensing technique to observe our patch of the universe. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> But they would see this sector of the cosmos as it appeared more than 13-billion years ago - perhaps a protogalaxy that would only later expand and evolve into the spiral-shaped disc of the Milky Way.</span></p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/17/2014111710021646734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/Images/2014/11/17/2014111710021646734_20.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-18 17:11:46','Kevin Holden',39.29038480,-76.61218930,NULL,NULL),(471,'2014111843546567116','http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia-pacific/2014/11/toyota-launch-hydrogen-powered-car-2014111843546567116.html','Toyota to launch hydrogen-powered car','World\'s largest car maker experiments with Mirai model, hoping to sell about 700 in the first year.

The legal framework, along with the international community\'s support for equal rights, has allowed Afghan women to make big strides during the past decade.   </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Still, women who symbolically take government offices or parliament seats and do not stir trouble might be tolerated.

There are a few conservative elements within the system, who reap the benefits of democracy and international aid, while sharing the Taliban\'s view that women have no place in the public sphere. They make up a small contingent, but thanks to the support they have enjoyed from the previous administration as well as the international community\'s hitherto acquiescence, their voices are loud. </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Bilateral Security Agreement</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">There are also rumours that the attack followed a series of threats that Barakzai and other women MPs had received last week, as they were seeking to gather signatures for the approval of the Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) between Afghanistan and the US - still pending approval from the parliament.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Former Afghan President Hamid Karzai had refused to sign the security pact, perhaps hoping to gain favours in certain \"moderate\" Taliban quarters and with their Pakistani supporters. The new Afghan administration signed it immediately, arguing that in the negotiations process, the most important Afghan concerns were raised and met favourably by the Americans.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">More importantly, the ratification of the BSA, as Ghani has argued time and again, would, for the first time since the US military intervention of 2001, return Afghan national sovereignty to the Afghan state. In the past 13 years, the presence of US and NATO forces on Afghan soil was legally justified through UN Security Council resolutions. The bilateral agreement would recognise the state of Afghanistan as the legitimate counterpart and decision-maker on the presence of US troops in the country.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Some MPs have raised objections to granting judicial immunity to US troops and want to see an end to the night raids and house searches.

I had made the team at 336 pounds, during my junior year in high school, even though all of my classmates were playing varsity, I was just happy to make the team. That day Coach Slappy looked at me as I entered the gym, and without giving me the chance to explain my tardiness, he put his index finger up and circled it in the air, directing me to run laps. I was ok with the punishment for the tardiness, but what I wasn\'t ok with was his insistence on the \"finger-circling\" when I asked and continued asking as I ran, \"how many laps, coach?\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">That day I felt as though I had received the worst punishment of my life. I could have run a 100 laps that day had he let me know how many laps I needed to run, but the psychological punishment was, for me, nothing short of torture. That day, I ran 29 laps around the basketball court, but every lap felt like the last one. By the time Coach Slappy remembered to tell me to stop, I was mentally and physically drained.</span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> I remembered this story on my 27th birthday - my second in prison - as I finished 290 days on hunger strike. It\'s exactly 10 years later, and I am 150 pounds lighter. I am sitting in an underground Egyptian dungeon reflecting on that basketball season and its relevance to my current circumstances. I have lost the sense of hunger, I lose consciousness often, I wake up to bruises and a bloody mouth almost daily and physical pain has become the norm. My body has become numb as it eats away at itself.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Psychological torture</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">But none of that is as painful as the psychological torture that the ambiguity of the detainment (under an indefinite temporary holding law) is imposing. This dark and gloomy nightmare that I have no clue how it descended on me so suddenly, how long it will last, how and when it will end. A much more extreme feeling than that of Coach Slappy\'s punishment, yet similar; mental and physical depletion. I do not know how long until this \"punishment\" ends, so every day passes like it is the last, slow and excruciating.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">And just when the rare tears filled up my eyes as I go down memory lane to that basketball season, it all began to come together.

By the end of the year, I was on the varsity basketball team with my classmates.</span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> I realised that that one day, Coach Slappy decided to punish me, he wanted to test my mental strength, my potential, and whether I had enough heart for the game.

There was no comparison of course; This test is much more extreme and definitely more painful, but just like the former made me stronger, this was also going to make me stronger. Just like I was prepped to be a better basketball player, I was being molded by God to be a wiser human, an effective leader, and a stronger advocate of freedom and peace. My coach\'s words - \"Hate every moment of training but love and cherish every second of victory\" - are ever-so relevant.</span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> A ray of optimism lit my heart.

Especially as it so happened that several days before the summit reports had emerged that \"Russian tanks and heavy artillery\" had crossed the border into Ukraine and all the usual suspects in Kiev and beyond made all the usual noises about Moscow \"escalating the crisis in eastern Ukraine\". </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Posturing and chest-beating</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">The stage was therefore set for some serious posturing and chest-beating in Brisbane, sparing hacks the humiliating task of tracking down some odd looking anti-globalists for an interview or filming stern-faced cops, looking into the distance purposefully, representing the \"unprecedented levels of security\". </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">In fact, the excitement had started even before the summit opened, with British Prime Minister David Cameron addressing journalists at a joint press conference with the host, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. Both pointed to the dangers of ignoring the lessons of history and letting a big country bully smaller ones. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Hacks added a bit of drama to his words and - presto! - we had headlines saying that Cameron had \"compared Russia to Nazi Germany\", with some especially excited journos even saying that he had \"likened Putin to Hitler\".   </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Then finally the Russian president arrived and the drama went into overdrive, with the poor \"angry protesters\" struggling to get noticed. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who usually gets overlooked at the G20 and G8 summits, was thrown into the spotlight on this occasion by supposedly telling Putin during their handshake to \"get out of Ukraine!\" At least that was how it happened according to Harper\'s aides; my own Russian sources told me that it was actually much more cordial than that, with Putin replying that there were no Russian troops in Ukraine and there was nothing to discuss. But hey, the drama still played out well in TV news bulletins, on the news wires and in news print. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">There were other cases of muscle flexing and posturing, with US President Barack Obama warning Putin that he risked further isolation if he didn\'t change his ways in Ukraine and rumours surfacing that German Chancellor Angela Merkel was hinting that more sanctions against Russia could follow. Cameron also had a chance to demonstrate that he was not to be taken lightly, giving Putin a handshake with attitude, before holding a one-on-one meeting with him. French President Francois Hollande had his stern expression on when he came to meet with Putin. The joke among the Russian journos accompanying Putin was that western leaders were all jealous of Putin\'s 88 per cent popularity rating - domestically. </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Something to write about</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Hacks were over the moon with all that excitement, thanking their lucky stars that they had something to write about for once from a G20 summit. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">The climax of the summit came when it was reported that Putin would be leaving Brisbane earlier than others, supposedly \"upset\" by all that criticism levelled at him. That gave more ammo to the hungry pack of reporters, keeping them guessing what Putin\'s real game was. The Russian president himself said that he had to leave earlier, <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia-pacific/2014/11/putin-walks-out-g20-summit-early-201411164322920220.html\" target=\"_blank\">to catch some sleep and be at his desk in the Kremlin</a> first thing in the morning the next day. Few people bought that but the overall conclusion was that Putin was not going to lose any sleep over what he had heard in Brisbane from his western counterparts concerning Ukraine and that the issue was not going away any time soon.       </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">And it was then that reality of another G20 summit kicked in and the media had to deal with a rather boring document that lacked any serious meat on its bones. For example, it stated that the G20 nations would increase their GDP by an additional 2 per cent by the year 2018, but contained no suggestions on how exactly it would be achieved. It also talked about job growth and an increase in investment, but again in very vague terms. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">The really exciting parts, according to some hacks, were the mention of climate and Ebola in the document but no deadlines or specific amounts of money were given so it was unclear how this would work. Sharing information on tax evasion was the only point that got some people going, but the lack of any commitment to make that information public took off a lot of the gloss from the proposal. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Hardly value for money for the $800 million spent on this summit. Still, at least there was a bit of drama for a change. </span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Alexander Nekrassov is a former Kremlin and government adviser.</span></i></STRONG></em></p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/images/2014/11/17//2014111765120261734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/images/2014/11/17/2014111765120261734_20.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-17 22:58:51','Alexander Nekrassov',-27.47101070,153.02344890,NULL,NULL),(501,'20141117113853152371','http://www.aljazeera.com/video/middleeast/2014/11/yemen-economy-verge-collapse-20141117113853152371.html','Yemen economy \'on verge of collapse\'','Months of political upheaval threaten to cut basic services such as medical care, water and electricity by end of year.','<p>Months of political upheaval in Yemen have damaged an economy that was already struggling.</p>\r\n<p>The UN has warned the country could collapse if the new government is not operational soon.

Livestock have been confiscated. One resident of the Old City, Sa’eed Shaloudi, was even ordered to remove his home’s water heater because it was installed without permission.</p>\r\n<p>Akram Jadallah, a resident of Beit Hanina in northeast Jerusalem, was two payments behind on his arnona, a bimonthly municipal tax levied on property owners here. Late payments are not uncommon in Israel; cities have the right to seize the property of delinquent landowners, but punishments are typically light - a small monthly fine for all but the worst offenders.</p>\r\n<p>In East Jerusalem, though, residents say back taxes and insurance payments have been used as a pretext to seize dozens of cars. \"They towed my car, and I couldn’t get it back until I paid the taxes and the towing fine,\" Jadallah said. \"I don’t think they do this in Talpiot,\" a Jewish neighbourhood in the west.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/10/jerusalem-simmering-over-judaisation-plan-2014101364013133843.html\" target=\"_blank\"> <span style=\"font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 16px;\"> RELATED: Jerusalem simmering over \'judaisation plan\' </span></a></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Mayor Nir Barkat denied that the crackdown was targeted at Palestinians, insisting that the law is applied equally. \"The mayor has a clear policy of enforcing the law in all parts of Jerusalem,\" Brachie Sprung, a spokeswoman for Barkat, told Al Jazeera. \"People who live in West Jerusalem pay for things they do illegally, and the same applies in the east.\" </p>\r\n<p>Indeed, the citations are not spurious: Some residents interviewed for this article acknowledged they were breaking the law. The problem, they say, is that these laws were not previously enforced.</p>\r\n<p>On November 11, for example, police issued dozens of parking tickets in Shuafat. Many of the offenders were parked on the curb, a virtual necessity in a neighbourhood with narrow streets and a shortage of municipal parking lots. \"It’s the first time they’ve ever done this,\" said Mahmoud Abu Khdair, who received a 500 shekel ($130) fine.</p>\r\n<p>Last week in Silwan, meanwhile, dozens of police officers set up checkpoints and stopped Palestinian drivers to issue tickets for various offences, many of them minor. A foreign motorist was allowed to enter the neighbourhood unimpeded.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p> East Jerusalem has been convulsed by months of unrest, dating back to the July murder of a Palestinian teenager, an act of revenge for the killing of three Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank. The murder set off a week of riots in Shuafat, his neighbourhood. Protests have continued almost every night since, with local youth throwing stones at police and firebombs at passing vehicles.</p>\r\n<p>Nearly half of the city’s light rail cars are out of service due to damage. Four people were killed in hit-and-run attacks over the past month, and a Palestinian man attempted to assassinate a right-wing Jewish activist.</p>\r\n<p>More than 1,300 residents of East Jerusalem have been arrested since the summer, <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ppsmo/posts/790644404333594\" target=\"_blank\"> 40 percent of them children</a>, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Club, an advocacy group.

The Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI), another local NGO, issues an annual report on East Jerusalem, and indicators in <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.acri.org.il/en/2014/05/24/ej-numbers-14/]\" target=\"_blank\"> this year’s report </a> were typically grim. \"The Israeli government has not allocated the necessary resources to develop East Jerusalem.

The designations were announced on the state\'s official news agency on November 15, marking a nefarious precedent where a government of a Muslim-majority state has designated a Muslim-American institution as a \"terrorist organisation\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">While the classification of both organisations as terrorist groups is alarming, the allegation against CAIR is particularly concerning. The advocacy organisation based out of Washington, DC, which encompasses 28 chapters across the United States, has stood as a vital and vocal opponent of state-sponsored discrimination against Muslim-Americans. In addition, CAIR - principally through its chapters - has carried forward unapologetic initiatives aimed at eroding Islamophobia and defending Muslim-American individuals and institutions during the post-9/11 era.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Regional politics, not CAIR\'s work stateside, moved the UAE to designate the civil rights organisation a terrorist group.

The ramifications are not only acute, but also extensive.       </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">A widening \'gulf\'</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Centuries old stereotypes, still embedded in the American imagination, <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"https://annualsurveryofamericanlaw.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/69-1_beydoun.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">conflate Muslims</a> - regardless of their nationality or locale - as one and the same.

This apathy may be a surprise to everyone in the US aside from Muslim-Americans, who can point to the dehumanisation of Muslim migrant workers within the Gulf region to highlight how religious affinity is seldom a source of apathy.    <br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">With heightening state and societal animosity toward Islam in the US, particularly with the recent emergence of ISIL, the UAE\'s designation of CAIR as \"terrorists\" shifts their state stance from apathy toward full-fledged assault. The designation has two considerable effects: first, it endorses specific allegations from right-wing US groups that <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/13/rahat-husain-fox-silences-muslim-challenges-condem/\" target=\"_blank\">CAIR colludes with terrorist networks</a>; and second, functions as testimony, from a native state informant, deepening the stereotype that critical Muslim-American civil rights organisations are subversive and anti-American. </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Abetting Islamophobia</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">CAIR is not designated a terrorist group within the US. However, the organisation and its leadership have fended off<a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/15/united-arab-emirates-designates-two-american-muslim-groups-as-terrorist-orgs/\" target=\"_blank\"> allegations of direct or indirect links</a> with state-designated terrorist groups for many years. The allegations, although legally tenuous, curried public perception that CAIR itself had terrorist affiliations. This led to increased government surveillance of its Executive Director, Nihad Awad, FBI probing of CAIR chapters and community outreach work, monitoring of Muslim-Americans seeking their counsel, and intensified slander from right-wing political leaders and media pundits.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">By classifying CAIR as a terrorist organisation, among the likes of ISIL, al-Qaeda, and Boko Haram, the move will embolden Islamophobic elements to pronounce their hateful rhetoric, and expedite draconian policies against Muslim-Americans.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Hussam Ayloush, Executive Director of CAIR\'s Greater Los Angeles chapter, echoes that the designation will \"fuel Islamophobia, and undermine the safety and well being of Muslim communities [in the United States] around the world\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Furthermore, the UAE designation will further complicate CAIR\'s ability to carry forward advocacy work protecting Muslim-Americans. Instead of marshaling manpower and resources to handling hate crimes cases, public workshops, and other direly needed initiatives, the designation will compel the organisation and its staff to respond to its placement on the terrorist list, and collaterally, deal with the barrage of political and private hate that is sure to follow. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Without question, the designation not only undermines the interests of CAIR, but also the nearly 8 million Muslim-Americans that benefit from its work. Among the <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/09/muslim-americans-presumed-guilt-201492981346604671.html\" target=\"_blank\">most marginalised and maligned communities</a> in the US, the Muslim-American plight is compounded by a dearth of effective and unapologetic advocacy groups.   </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Therefore, formal condemnation of their most prominent defender will trickle down to hold them vicariously liable of \"terrorism\", a perspective already widely held in the US. While the UAE formally alleging CAIR to be a terrorist organisation is as reprehensible as it is self-serving, the forthcoming allegations that the move is abetting Islamophobia in the US are both precise and deserving.   </span></p>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Khaled A Beydoun is an Assistant Professor of Law at the Barry University Dwayne O Andreas School of Law.

The myth of the \'heavenly hundred\' has helped to contribute and consolidate such civic-mindedness and constitutional patriotism.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Shekhovtsov is referring to the 100 or so martyrs at Maidan who were shot and killed by riot police. Ukrainians died there, but also Russians, Poles, Georgians, Armenians and even a few Jews.</span></p>\r\n<p>Back in Podil, Zissels pours cold water on the notion that Maidan represented some kind of backward or retrograde nationalism.</p>\r\n<p>\"No, no, no,\" he says, shaking his head. If anything, he remarks, the 2004 Orange Revolution, which also flared in Kiev\'s Maidan, was more nationalistic than recent protests against Yanukovych. Moreover, few members of ethnic minorities took part in the previous Maidan, in contrast to more current demonstrations.</p>\r\n<p>\"During [the recent] Maidan,\" Zissels declares, \"We Jews and other ethnic minorities did not feel threatened by what was happening.\"</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Zissels certainly concedes that right-wing nationalists were visible in the recent Maidan. However, he says, \"they don\'t play a major role…and they aren\'t very numerically strong\".</p>\r\n<p>In fact, when Yanukovych authorities tried to disperse protesters on Maidan, people formed self-defence units (including a \"Jewish Division\"), which had no links to right-wing nationalists. At the end of January, 2014 Zissels estimates that such self-defense units comprised some 15,000 people. At the time, nationalists affiliated with Svoboda had just several hundred people under its banner. </p>\r\n<p>Denis Pilash, a political activist who took part in Maidan protests, says \"demonstrators were playing all kinds of bad nationalistic music on stage.\" On the other hand, he adds, \"there was also a Jewish klezmer band and the majority of people were fine with that.\"</p>\r\n<p>Pilash adds that many Ukrainians \"are eager to embrace Jews and other ethnic minorities.\"</p>\r\n<p>Nevertheless, he guards against complacency and fears the political mainstream hasn\'t been sufficiently critical of the far right. Indeed, stereotypes and jokes about Jews persist, and \"there\'s always a certain tolerance for the right which could lead to resurgence.\" </p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Ukrainian Jews and the war</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>In light of intensifying hostilities in the east against Russian-separatists, such fears might not be unfounded. Tetiana Bezruk, a researcher at the Congress of National Communities of Ukraine, is concerned about the rise of the fascistic Azov Battalion which battles separatists while brandishing symbols similar to those worn by Waffen SS units during World War II.</p>\r\n<p>\"The Azov Battalion is one of the biggest problems right now,\" Bezruk remarks. \"People are very respectful toward anyone who is currently fighting, and it doesn\'t matter what your politics is.\"</p>\r\n<p>While many Ukrainian Jews are certainly aware of fascist military units, they are still keen to demonstrate their patriotism.</p>\r\n<p>Pereyaslav, located some 60 miles south of Kiev, was once home to Yiddish literary legend Shalom Aleichem (1859-1916) and the stage and film musical \"Fiddler on the Roof\" was based on his stories. Iryna Kucherenko, director of the Shalom Aleichem museum, says the local Jewish community isn\'t too concerned with right wing nationalism. Jewish women in Pereyaslav, she says, want to support the Ukrainian war effort by helping to provide soldiers with appropriate body armour. Kucherenko adds for good measure that a Jewish battalion recently deployed to the front. </p>\r\n<p>Perhaps, the war will serve to integrate Ukrainian Jews more fully into society. One local Jewish \"oligarch\", Igor Kolomoisky, recently created volunteer battalions which took part in the war. Kolomoisky is the governor of Dnipropetrovsk no less, an important industrial area. In media and political circles, Kolomoisky is referred to as a power broker and his ethnic or religious identity is glossed over. </p>\r\n<p>While it would be premature at this point to declare the death of anti-Semitism in Ukraine, figures such as Kolomoisky have done much to change attitudes. Indeed, through his own patriotic endeavours, he has made it hard to question Jewish loyalty to the Ukrainian state. Nevertheless, Ukrainians should be careful not to fall into a lull or fail to call out fascists in the midst of war.</p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i>Nikolas Kozloff is the author of Revolution!

But orang-utans continue to be driven from their treetop homes.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Over the past four years, Sanchez has lodged a number of complaints about oil palm companies that she said are breaching the conditions of their RSPO membership. \"It\'s going very slowly,\" she said. \"We believe that they continue to do things that contravene the principles and criteria of the RSPO.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Creating standards</i></STRONG></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The RSPO began 10 years ago as an initiative between NGOs such as the World Wildlife Fund, planters, mills and traders to improve sustainability in the multi-billion dollar palm oil industry, and to make companies do business more responsibly.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Now, the RSPO is facing criticism - not only from those who believe it is too weak, but also from those who think its standards are too stringent. \"RSPO\'s biggest challenge is to evolve as a standard for all palm oil producers,\" Reza Azmi, executive director of Wild Asia, an environmental group that works with palm oil smallholders, told Al Jazeera.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"The standard - the way it\'s managed and its codified rules - will need to adapt to accommodate smaller producers, producers from emerging palm regions, and grow to be a minimum standard for all; not an exclusive club of large, publicly listed corporations.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Since 2004, the RSPO\'s membership has expanded rapidly and includes some of the world\'s top plantation companies such as Malaysia\'s Sime Darby and leading buyers like Singapore-based commodity trader Wilmar. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"One of the key indicators of how much we have done is that today, 18 percent of crude palm oil is certified as sustainable,\" the organisation\'s Secretary-General Darrel Webber said. \"We have 1,800 members spread over 72 countries, when the founders were between five and seven.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Governing edible oil</i></STRONG></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">RSPO members will gather in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia this week for an annual meeting to discuss, among other things, the implementation of the more stringent standards agreed upon last year, an improved complaints process, expansion into Africa and India, and ways to help smaller growers meet the sustainability measures.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">But some say the RSPO does not go far enough in governing the edible oil that has become ubiquitous in everyday life. Palm oil is an ingredient found in foods, such as ice cream and doughnuts, and a crucial component of soap, shampoo and cleaning fluids.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Although the WWF backed the new criteria - which took two years of discussion and compromise - it also noted its disappointment at the outcome in a public statement. While it has not abandoned the RSPO, the WWF has called on what it termed \"progressive\" companies to meet <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://d2ouvy59p0dg6k.cloudfront.net/downloads/wwf_statement_revised_rspo_principlescriteria_april_2013.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">higher standards</a>.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Greenpeace went further. In a highly critical report, <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/publications/Campaign-reports/Forests-Reports/Certifying-Destruction/\" target=\"_blank\">Certifying Destruction</a>, it said palm oil was the single largest driver of deforestation in Indonesia between 2009 and 2011, and three-quarters of deforestation in West Kalimantan province could be blamed on the industry.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The report accused the RSPO of leaving its members \"free to destroy forests\", and argued the lack of supply chain traceability allowed companies to \"launder\" what it called dirty palm oil through the certified product.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Too demanding</i></STRONG></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Still, some industry insiders argue RSPO is dominated by Western NGOs and big buyers, and its stricter benchmarks are too demanding and expensive for smaller producers to implement.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"Nothing is being done to be inclusive enough for the small farmers to be able to qualify and send their oil to the big boys and have good market access to Europe,\" Yusof Basiron, chief executive of the Malaysian Palm Oil Council, told Al Jazeera in an interview at his office in the suburbs of Kuala Lumpur. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"You want to get these small farmers to adopt RSPO, you need an army of agents to educate them and enough money to get them on board.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Instead, Malaysia, the world\'s second-largest producer of palm oil after Indonesia, has been developing its own standards. <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.mpoc.org.my/upload/IPOSC-2014-Malaysian-Sustainable-Palm-Oil-Current-Status-Dr-Ainie-Kuntom.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">MSPO</a>, as the standards are known, will launch in January. \"We want a more professional, unbiased way of developing standards,\" Yusof said, claiming that RSPO discriminates not only against small-holders, but developing countries generally. Indonesia, too, has created its own national benchmark.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">But the push for more demanding standards continues to gain momentum. While remaining within RSPO, WWF and Greenpeace have set up the <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.forestpeoples.org/sites/fpp/files/publication/2013/11/palmoilinnovationsgroupcharter.pdf%20\" target=\"_blank\">Palm Oil Innovation Group</a> - designed to raise the bar further by committing companies to the protection of both primary and secondary forest, stopping the expansion of plantations on peat land, and creating a mechanism to trace the origins of the oil.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"Since mid-2013, I have seen a major shift,\" said Wild Asia\'s Azmi. \"It appeared that suddenly the market realised that even with RSPO certification, the criticism of palm oil or certified producers did not go away. We now have many major buyers investing in their own \'supply chain\' investigations and communicating \'zero deforestation\' policies. I fear that RSPO may simply be side-stepped.\" </span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Last December, Wilmar, which controls about 45 percent of the global palm oil trade, announced its commitment to <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"%20http://www.wilmar-international.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/No-Deforestation-No-Peat-No-Exploitation-Policy.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">zero deforestation</a>. The breakthrough came six months after smoke from peat and forest fires in Indonesia shrouded both Singapore and Malaysia in a choking haze that pushed air pollution to hazardous levels in some areas, and forced the closure of schools.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Not demanding enough</i></STRONG></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The decision was the biggest breakthrough yet for the groups pushing companies to commit to higher standards.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"The RSPO doesn\'t go far enough,\" said Forest Heroes\' campaign director Deborah Lapidus. \"It just requires the protection of untouched, primary forest, but still allows for clearance of secondary forest, which contains a lot of carbon stock and endangered animals. And RSPO does not prohibit the draining of peat lands.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Just one-year old, Forest Heroes aims to raise awareness among Western consumers about palm oil and its effects on the environment, targeting big buyers of palm oil to convince them to commit to zero deforestation. In October, New York-based trader Bunge, whose clients include doughnut maker Krispy Kreme, became the latest to promise zero deforestation.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"I have seen a sea change in the industry over the past year or so,\" Lapidus said. \"And it\'s precisely because we decided that RSPO was irrelevant.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">But the RSPO\'s Webber insisted the organisation continues to have an important role. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"The RSPO\'s not just about a standard,\" Webber said. \"We are about transparency. We add credibility. We are an avenue to seek recourse. We have global maps of our certified members that you can see online <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.rspo.org/\" target=\"_blank\">www.rspo.org</a> now, check where they are, whether they\'ve deforested in the past.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"No other commodity, I think, has done the same. It\'s only palm oil that\'s done it and it\'s palm oil through the RSPO that\'s done it,\" he added.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Although just one company has been expelled from RSPO since its inception, Webber said the threat of expulsion remains.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">However, he added it is better for companies to work within the system than outside it.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"We do terminate and we do suspend,\" he said. \"But we try our best to mediate. Conflicts do not stop if we terminate a member.

The plan dwells on how the South Korean government should handle such a scenario and what should be done to transform the North Korean economy. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">The South Korean military is known to do regular rounds of contingency planning for a possible regime collapse in the North. However, such plans usually focus upon the immediate response of the military. The new plan is seemingly different because it considers what should be done in the longer-term. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">On paper, both Koreas are firmly committed to the principle of national unification. Of course, during official contacts between the two governments, both sides regularly pay lip service to the idea that their eventual unification should be peaceful, gradual and agreed upon by the two current governments, currently co-existing on the Korean peninsula. Some in South Korea sincerely believe that such pronouncements bear some relation to reality. But in real life, a gradual unification is highly unlikely, if not outright impossible. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Now, when the world celebrates the 25th anniversary of German unification, it is a good time to be reminded: If the two Koreas are to be re-united in the foreseeable future, the German scenario is highly likely to be repeated on the Korean peninsula. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><STRONG><i>Great triumph?</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Officially, Koreans on both sides of the border are supposed to believe that unification, in whatever form it eventually comes, would be a great triumph for their long-suffering nation - recently, the ROK president even said that unification would be a \"bonanza\" for her country. However, with the passage of time, it becomes increasingly clear that the younger generation of South Koreans have different opinions about unification. Put simply, younger Koreans do not see Northerners as their brethren, and are not willing to make sacrifices for the impoverished North. At the same time, there is a belief, especially among the younger generation, that the immediate <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.newrepublic.com/article/world/magazine/92781/korean-unification\" target=\"_blank\">economic impact of unification</a> is likely to be disastrous for the taxpayers of the rich South. </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">There are significant reasons that should have the South Korean public worried. In the past decade or so, there have been over a dozen attempts to estimate how much unification is going to cost South Korea. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Given the near complete absence of reliable statistics regarding the state of the North Korean economy, and the near unprecedented nature of the task, one shouldn\'t be surprised that estimates vary considerably. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Be that as it may, most of the estimates cluster around two points: optimists believe that unification is likely to cost about $200 billion, while pessimists believe that the figure is liable to be in the neighbourhood of $1.5 trillion. Both camps believe that their respective figures represent the amount of money required to narrow the <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704340304574635180086832934\" target=\"_blank\">income gap between the two Koreas</a>. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Currently, the entire GDP of South Korea is <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2195.html\" target=\"_blank\">roughly $1.2 trillion</a>, so even at the low end we are talking about a massive burden. If pessimists are correct, the burden could be truly crushing, capable of wiping out the South Korean economy.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><STRONG><i>Income gap</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Once upon a time, North Korea was well ahead of the South in its per capita income (largely, but not exclusively, because it inherited pretty much all the industry the Japanese companies built in Korea during the colonial industrialisation boom of the 1930s and 1940s). These years are long gone, though. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">After 1960, it would be a minor exaggeration to say that Korean economic history can be presented as the near perfect success of the South and near perfect failure of the North. The results are clear for all to see. Exact estimates remain impossible because the North Korean government ceased to release all economic statistics in the early 1960s, but the per capita GDP in the South has been estimated to be <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/datablog/2013/apr/08/south-korea-v-north-korea-compared\" target=\"_blank\">between 14 and 30 times higher than the North</a>. Even if we take the most conservative estimate, this still means that the per capita income gap between the two Koreas is the world\'s largest gap between two countries that share a land border.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">When it comes to social and cultural issues, the gap is equally great. For security reasons, the North Korean government has always been very careful in controlling interaction between its citizens and the outside world. As a result, the average North Korean has very little understanding about the ways a modern society operates. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">It is not incidental that North Korean refugees in the South do not normally fare well: their average income is roughly half the nationwide average, they have great difficulties in finding work and basically find themselves ill-adapted to life in a modern, technologically advanced, hyper-dynamic and highly competitive society. Given that defectors usually come from more socially active groups of the population, this bodes ill for the future of a unified Korea. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">No wonder that the above mentioned report assume that the unemployment rate in the post-unification North might reach the totally unprecedented 30 percent level. Indeed, one can only wonder what would happen to North Korean engineers who might have good training in calculus, but have never used computers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Similarly, North Korean medical doctors who are well educated in treatments and drugs that would be seen as out of date in the 1960s are likely to be lost. Manual workers, trained in the 1930s technology, would also be of little use in the high-tech economy of the South. And what of the North Korean Army, one of the largest standing military forces in the world, that currently has over one million soldiers? </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><STRONG><i>Exposure to capitalism</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Should German-style unification occur on the Korean peninsula, North Koreans would immediately find themselves exposed to the ways of modern capitalism, of which they currently have very vague ideas. One can easily imagine how South Korean speculators would descend on the North and buy all valuable property they can find (they will be able to afford it with their far higher incomes). And the scions of former North Korean landlords, whose lands were confiscated during the 1946 land reform, are also likely to reappear and make their claims on what used to be their great-grandfathers\' lands.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">This does not mean that unification will ruin the North Koreans. Most likely, in absolute terms it will bring fast and dramatic improvements to their living standards, albeit accompanied by great social confusion and, perhaps, sense of alienation. For the Southerners, things are different. In the long run, the unification will indeed make Korea a safer and better place, but its immediate impact will be a crushing blow to the South Korean taxpayers - and they are increasingly aware of this.<br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">All of this is understandable, but it does not negate one fact: unification can happen regardless of what people want and what they fear. History seldom cares about us, humble humans, and as the experience of countless crises and revolutions has shown, the situation can easily get out of control. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">After all, the existence of the rich South is a great destabilising factor in itself. East Germans challenged their state once it became clear that Soviet tanks would not come to crush their rebellion. They wanted western freedom and, even more, they wanted western prosperity.

He would complete his degree in architecture at Balamand University, located near the northern city of Tripoli, and return to Aleppo to work in his father’s civil engineering company.</p>\r\n<p>\"I already had an office there and everything,\" Ikhlassi told Al Jazeera. \"My future was planned.\"</p>\r\n<p>Four years later, his entire family has left Syria due to the civil war, and his father’s company no longer exists. As for Ikhlassi, \"I [no longer] know what is going to happen next year.\"</p>\r\n<p>Ikhlassi’s case is not isolated. According to statistics published by the University of California Davis and the Institute of International Education, more than 6,000 Syrians were enrolled in Lebanese University, the country\'s largest university, in the 2010-2011 school year.Thousands more attended Lebanon’s 43 other universities.</p>\r\n<p>When these students left their homes in 2010, the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad had not yet begun - but the ensuing civil war, which has displaced more than <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://syrianrefugees.eu/\" target=\"_blank\"> 9 million people </a>and killed nearly <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/22/syria-civil-war-death-toll-191300-un\" target=\"_blank\"> 200,000</a>, has shaped the course of their educational experiences and futures.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/video/middleeast/2014/09/syrian-refugees-lebanon-under-threat-201491173120299920.html\" target=\"_blank\"> <span style=\"font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 16px;\"> RELATED: Syrian refugees in Lebanon under threat </span></a></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Mamoun Mahayni, a student at the American University of Beirut (AUB) from Damascus, remembers his first semester revolving around normal university activities: making new friends, attending classes and getting used to life away from home. \"There was nothing out the ordinary,\" he told Al Jazeera.</p>\r\n<p>As the uprising started, however, Syrian communities on Lebanese campuses fractured into rival groups. At Balamand, students launched opposing campus organisations, Ikhlassi said, and many now wear wristbands with the regime or opposition flag, depending on their affiliation.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, with the transition from uprising to civil war, the Syrian <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://time.com/48294/syria-economy-30-years-unrwa/\" target=\"_blank\"> economy collapsed</a>, making it difficult for many to continue to afford tuition in Lebanon’s universities. Syrians, including students, also faced growing discrimination as more refugees entered Lebanon.</p>\r\n<p>In certain areas of Beirut, Mahayni said, self-proclaimed neighbourhood watchmen have set up night patrols to impose <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/lebanon-syria-refugees-face-growing-discrimination-111530488.html\" target=\"_blank\"> unofficial curfews </a> on Syrians. \"I’ve gone to several of these areas, and I’ve been stopped,\" he said.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p> Syrian students have also faced difficulty along Lebanon’s borders, which are now being more <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2014/Oct-20/274632-lebanon-drastically-limits-syrian-refugee-entry.ashx#axzz3IHemP3S6\" target=\"_blank\"> tightly controlled</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Majd Nassan, also an AUB student, recently travelled to Damascus to visit his family. On the way back, he was forced to wait in the scorching heat at the border for more than six hours with hundreds of other Syrians. When he approached Lebanese border security to ask about the delay, he says he was treated as if \"I was no longer a human being\".</p>\r\n<p>Yara Qtaish, a student at Lebanese University from Suwayda, said Lebanese state security officials had been holding her passport for 10 months while processing her application to extend her residency permit. They gave her a temporary ID, but until she receives her passport, she cannot leave Lebanon.</p>\r\n<p>\"I’m waiting [to]… go back to Syria to see my dad because I haven’t seen him in… two-and-a-half years,\" she said. \"I’m basically stuck.\"</p>\r\n<p>Renewing Syrian passports, which expire every six years, can be dangerous in some cases. Mahayni, a critic of the Assad regime, is reluctant to go the Syrian embassy to renew his passport for fear that he might be questioned.</p>\r\n<p>\"Part of my family has been persecuted and murdered by the regime,\" he said. \"I’m kind of outspoken on the issue, so I could be targeted.\"</p>\r\n<p>Syria’s mandatory military <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/syria-crisis-causes-spike-draft-dodging\" target=\"_blank\"> conscription </a> for men over 18 is another major factor preventing many soon-to-be graduates from returning home. Nassan, who graduates in December, said he might be able to go home one more time before his deferment expires. \"I don’t think I can go after that,\" he said, noting he cannot afford the hefty fee to waive his service.</p>\r\n<p>Many Western countries also remain closed to Syrians stranded by the conflict. The United States has only resettled <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/02/america-syria-refugee-resettlement-do-better-now\" target=\"_blank\"> 121 Syrian refugees </a> since 2011. \"You can’t move to Europe because the Europeans won’t let anyone in.

I have no idea where to apply for jobs… where to go or if I can stay in Lebanon… Should I leave, what country would take me?\"</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p> For her part, Diana Salahieh, another AUB student from Aleppo, used to think she would work abroad for several years before returning to Syria. \"Syria, for me… was probably in 10 years,\" she explained. \"Now, that 10-year plan is probably a 50-year plan.\"</p>\r\n<p>Some, however, have found purpose in the tragedies of the war. After taking the spring semester off in 2012 and returning to Damascus, Nassan switched his major from computer science to political studies with a concentration in conflict resolution.  </p>\r\n<p>\"I live in old Damascus and… thinking deep inside that at one point this might get destroyed… I couldn’t accept that thought,\" he explained.</p>\r\n<p>Nassan plans to pursue a master’s degree in conflict resolution and then return to Syria, when he has the qualifications and experience to help. \"I was a lost soul when I started university,\" Nassan said. \"Now, my goal is to try to help the people of Syria.\"</p>\r\n<p>All of the students interviewed shared his desire to seek further education and professional experience abroad, calling it their only viable option. Many also want to return to Syria when they have an opportunity to contribute to the post-war reconstruction.</p>\r\n<p>Ikhlassi, however - who had never considered a future outside of Syria before - now cannot imagine building a life there. \"There’s a future for maybe the next generation, but not ours,\" he said.</p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i>Follow Eric on Twitter: <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"twitter.com/eric_reidy\" target=\"_blank\">@eric_reidy</a></i></STRONG></em></p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/15/2014111591936316734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/Images/2014/11/15/2014111591936316734_20.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-15 20:37:19','Al Jazeera',0.00000000,0.00000000,NULL,NULL),(575,'2014111582640303729','http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/top-us-general-iraq-as-campaign-expand-2014111582640303729.html','Top US general in Iraq to assess campaign','General Martin Dempsey says he wants \"to get a sense\" of how US contribution to Iraq\'s fight against ISIL is going.','<p>General Martin Dempsey, the top US military officer, has arrived in Baghdad on an unannounced visit to meet US commanders preparing to expand American assistance to Iraqi and Kurdish forces battling the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group.</p>\r\n<p>It was Dempsey\'s first trip to Iraq since US President Barack Obama, alarmed by ISIL advances, ordered non-combatant American forces back into the country this summer, less than three years after withdrawing US troops from Iraq.</p>\r\n<p>The US began carrying out air strikes in August.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"I want to get a sense from our side about how our contribution is going,\" Dempsey, chairman of the US military\'s Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Reuters news agency shortly before landing in Baghdad.</p>\r\n<p>\"I want to hear from those actually doing the lifting that they\'ve the resources they need and the proper guidance to use those resources.\"</p>\r\n<p>Last week, Obama authorised sending up to 1,500 more forces to Iraq, roughly doubling the planned US troop presence as the United States expands its advisory mission and starts training Iraqi and Kurdish forces.</p>\r\n<p>Dempsey was due to meet US officials overseeing the effort, including Kuwait-based task force commander Lieutenant General James Terry, as well as Iraqi officials.</p>\r\n<p>\"This will work best if we\'re enabling [Iraq\'s] plan,\" Dempsey, who last visited Iraq in 2012, said.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Gains against ISIL </i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>Dempsey\'s visit comes in the wake of Iraqi battlefield advances touted by US officials, including retaking areas around the country\'s biggest refinery near the city of Baiji.</p>\r\n<p>Kurdish forces pushed ISIL out of the town of Zumar in northern Iraq and US air strikes hit a gathering of ISIL battlefield commanders near Mosul just over a week ago.</p>\r\n<p>Still, ISIL remains defiant, and has dug into key Iraqi cities, including Mosul.</p>\r\n<p>An audio message purported to be from the group\'s leader this week urged supporters in Saudi Arabia to take the fight to the rulers of the kingdom, which has joined the US-led coalition in mounting air strikes against ISIL in Syria.</p>\r\n<p>About 1,400 US troops are now on the ground, just below the previous limit of 1,600 troops.

Here, he gives us an account of what actually happened.</span></em></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">First, let\'s take a look at the facts. On November 9-10, I attended an EU-sponsored conference held in Cairo on \"problems of translation\". I decided to stay on a few more days to meet some people in order to take stock of any changes and iron out some problems related to the Arabic edition of <em>Le Monde Diplomatique</em>.</span> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: \'Arial\',\'sans-serif\'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> On November 11, at 11am, in an upscale cafe located in front of the British Embassy - whose impressive size serves as a reminder that Britain once ruled over an occupied Egypt - I met two Egyptian friends: One is a columnist, the other a student. The place was small and the tables are very near to each other, but I did not pay attention to our neighbours. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: \'Arial\',\'sans-serif\'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> The conversation went on; we were speaking in both Arabic and English about what was happening in the country, the situation in the universities and the state of the media. After half an hour, a well-dressed lady sitting next to us - and of whom I had taken no notice - stood-up visibly furious and addressed us, before leaving the place, saying: \"You want to destroy the country!\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: \'Arial\',\'sans-serif\'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> We did not respond and continued our conversation. Shortly afterwards, a man entered the cafe, presumably an agent of the \"mukhabarat\" (state intelligence) and sat down - but we did not pay attention to him either. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: \'Arial\',\'sans-serif\'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> <STRONG><i> Apprehended </i></STRONG> <br /> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: \'Arial\',\'sans-serif\'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> The moment we stepped out of the cafe, <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/world/middleeast/journalists-detained-for-talking-politics-in-cairo-cafe.html?_r=0\"> we were apprehended </a> by that same man, who had left the place just before we did, and some other officers in uniform. It is worth mentioning that we were well treated throughout. The police even brought a chair to one of the two women who was pregnant. Then they took our identity papers and started questioning each one of us, there in the street. In my case, they asked where I was staying in Cairo, why I changed hotels during my stay and when I arrived in Egypt. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: \'Arial\',\'sans-serif\'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> After half an hour, they gave me back my passport and told me to leave. I refused, as the other two people were not free to leave too. Five minutes later, they took my passport again, and one of the officers asked me if I had an authorisation from the Ministry of Information; I did not. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: \'Arial\',\'sans-serif\'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> Following my answer, that same officer, thinking he had me cornered, replied: \"And if I had to interview people in France, wouldn\'t I need authorisation?\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: \'Arial\',\'sans-serif\'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> He was surprised by my negative response. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: \'Arial\',\'sans-serif\'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> An hour later, I informed the French Embassy as well as the head of the Egyptian Journalists\' Syndicate. Following this episode, many figures were informed including, apparently, the Egyptian prime minister and most certainly the interior ministry. I was then set \"free\". But again, the two women were still not free to leave. For this reason, I refused to leave without them and again called the head of the Journalists\' Syndicate. Finally they let us all go. The incident lasted an hour and a half. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: \'Arial\',\'sans-serif\'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> Back at the hotel, at 6 pm, I received a call from the interior ministry. I was told that a car would pick me up and take me to the ministry. A meeting was held with the deputy minister of human rights (a military general) in the presence of other generals. Apologies were expressed, saying it was a \"mistake\" to have arrested me. </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: \'Arial\',\'sans-serif\'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">  This incident raises three important questions. The most serious issue at stake is obviously not the arrest itself, but the fact that we have been denounced by a \"good citizen\". This move reflects the dominating atmosphere in the country and to which most of the media, including the privately-owned ones, are contributing. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: \'Arial\',\'sans-serif\'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> <STRONG><i> Harming the state </i></STRONG> <br /> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: \'Arial\',\'sans-serif\'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> Recently, newspapers and TV channels\' directors have argued that because of the war on terrorism, they refrain from publishing any information that could harm the state - albeit, hundreds of journalists have signed a petition against that.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: \'Arial\',\'sans-serif\'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span>Moreover, TV channels denounce anyone who makes the slightest criticism. Journalists with different views have been practically excluded from daily newspapers\' columns. A segment of the public is very vigilant, convinced that Egypt is subject to an insidious European-US-Israeli plot - which is quite ironic, given the strong relationship between Cairo and Tel Aviv now. The atmosphere is reminiscent of the United States in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, which was summed up by President George W Bush\'s slogan: \"Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.\"</span><br /><br /><span>The second issue is about the power of social media that spread the news of my experience with a speed and force that surprised me. Within hours, the word spread across the world. I have received many messages of support. I have been interviewed by numerous TV channels. The Commissioner of the European Union responsible for human rights issues has even issued a condemnation</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: \'Arial\',\'sans-serif\'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> Thirdly, I cannot help but think that these reactions, partly exaggerated, were related to my status as a \"white journalist\". In other words, there are thousands of political prisoners in Egypt, some of whom are on hunger strike and may die, as well as arbitrary arrests and proven cases of torture that should be raising more indignation and condemnation. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: \'Arial\',\'sans-serif\'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> That being said, all the better if this incident draws attention to those cases. My thoughts go primarily to the <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/09/ahmed-seif-egypt-prison-generat-201491464914579626.html\" target=\"_blank\"> political prisoners on hunger strike </a> , including Alaa Abdel Fattah and Mohamed Sultan.

All 50 of Japan\'s remaining nuclear plants were shut down following the 2011 disaster. </span></p>\r\n<p>Greenpeace began independently monitoring radiation in Fukushima within a few days of the nuclear accident, and it has conducted field trips each year since then. The latest such trip took place from October 24-27.</p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Heinz Smitai, a nuclear physicist, Greenpeace campaigner and participant in the radiation monitoring mission, told foreign journalists at an October 30 press conference in Tokyo </span>that radiation hot spots exist as far as 60 kilometres from the site of the disaster.</p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">For instance, one street in front of a hospital in Fukushima City \"is quite contaminated\", Smitai said, measuring 1.1 microsieverts of radiation per hour. Although this was one of the highest readings, Greenpeace found 70 other places in the city where the amount of radiation recorded exceeded the Ministry of Environment\'s long-term target of 0.23 microsieverts per hour.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">A sievert is the standard unit for measuring the risk of radiation absorbed by the body. A millisievert is equal to one-thousandth of a sievert, while a microsievert is one-millionth of a sievert. A typical CT scan can deliver from 2 to 10 millisieverts of radiation, depending on the area being scanned.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Radiation \'hot spots\'</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>Greenpeace also monitored contamination in Miyakoji and Kawauchi, the first two locations in the 20-kilometre exclusion zone around the Daiichi plant where the government has lifted its evacuation advisory.</p>\r\n<p>Nevertheless, Greenpeace found numerous points on roads in these areas that exceeded the target of 0.23 microsieverts per hour.</p>\r\n<p>\"And when you leave the roads and go into the fields and surrounding forests, the radiation levels go up very strongly,\" said Jan van de Putte, a radioactivity safety advisor in Greenpeace who also participated in the Fukushima monitoring mission. Most of these areas therefore have \"not been decontaminated, and cannot be decontaminated because, for instance, a forest can\'t be decontaminated, practically speaking\", he added.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Japan\'s Ministry of Environment (MOE) disputes Greenpeace\'s claim that it is underestimating radiation contamination and its risks. It points out that radiation in Fukushima has steadily diminished over time, as indicated by the most recent Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) airborne monitoring survey, conducted in December 2013. An MOE spokesperson told Al Jazeera that radiation rates \"around Fukushima have significantly decreased [compared to October 2012 NRA survey] due to physical decay, weathering, and decontamination efforts\".</p>\r\n<p>Critics, however, charge that these results were found by averaging the radiation measurements, meaning that individual \"hot spots\" such as those Greenpeace claims to have found could go unstated.</p>\r\n<p>\"There can still be buildups of [radiation doses] higher than the average result,\" said Ritsuo Yoshioka, an expert in nuclear reactor engineering and safety, and president of the Japan Functional Safety Laboratory. \"Fukushima residents want to know what the radiation effects are in their local areas.\"</p>\r\n<p>The government says such a means of testing is already being provided. \"At the end of 2013, individual exposure rates measured with individual dosimeters were less than 1 millisievert [annualised] for more than 93 percent of Fukushima City residents,\" the MOE spokesperson pointed out.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Natural decay</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>In dealing with different monitoring methods and their results, it\'s important to maintain a sense of perspective, Azby Brown, a<a href=\"http://blog.safecast.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> member of Safecast</a>, told Al Jazeera. Safecast is an apolitical, independent radiation monitoring group made up of volunteers including radiation engineers, software and hardware designers and university professors.</p>\r\n<p>\"Yes, it\'s easy to find locations in Fukushima City and elsewhere that are still above 0.23 microsieverts an hour,\" said Brown. \"But in almost every conceivable case, even if nothing is done to clean up a place that currently gives 1 millisievert exposure per year, it will give 0.5 millisieverts or less a year after 30 years, due to natural radioactive decay.\"</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, Brown agrees that Fukushima residents have justifiable grievances. \"While experts on both sides tell me the increased risk of fatal cancer with few exceptions is likely to be less than one percent over their lifetimes, this is not the point. It\'s the injustice of having this risk thrust upon them, and the turmoil the accident has caused, that matters.\"</p>\r\n<p>Greenpeace, which wants to eliminate all nuclear power, immediately presented its findings to the Kagoshima prefectural government. Kagoshima, located in the southernmost part of the island of Kyushu, is host to the Sendai nuclear power plant.</p>\r\n<p>Gearing up for a fight In September the plant\'s two reactors were declared safe to operate the first in the country to be so designated by Japan\'s Nuclear Regulation Authority, after the plant met strict new safety criteria. As a result, Kagoshima has been the focus of lobbying by the central government on the one hand and by organisations opposing it, like Greenpeace, on the other.</p>\r\n<p>The central government wants to restart the Sendai plant and others, to cut down on expensive natural gas and oil imports and diversify the country\'s energy mix. But antinuclear groups say the risks are unacceptably high, pointing to what happened in Fukushima.</p>\r\n<p>After debating the issue, the Kagoshima prefectural assembly voted on November 7 to restart the plant, which is operated by Kyushu Electric Power Company. The yes vote echoed a similar decision a week earlier by the Satsuma Sendai assembly, which hosts the plant.</p>\r\n<p>In a press conference following his decision, Kagoshima Governor Yuichiro Ito said that after considering every possible factor, \"restarting the plant had to happen\" citing Japan\'s limited natural resources and the need to keep industry moving.</p>\r\n<p>NHK, Japan\'s public radio and TV broadcaster, conducted a phone survey on the subject from October 31 to November 3. In Satsuma Sendai 49 percent approved, while 44 percent disapproved. But in the surrounding areas only 34 percent approved, with 58 percent opposed. In the rest of the country, the figures stood at 32 percent for, versus 57 percent against.</p>\r\n<p>Yoshioka, the safety expert, said groups opposed to reactivating nuclear plants in their respective areas would be able to argue their cases more strongly if they banded together. He mentioned that in Hakodate, the city assembly filed suit in April to stop the construction of the new Oma nuclear plant, which is 23 km away in a different prefecture.</p>\r\n<p>With operators of Japan\'s 48 other nuclear reactors also fighting for their plants to be reactivated, it\'s clear this battle has only just begun.</p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">(Editor\'s note: This story originally appeared on the website on November 13, 2014, but was briefly taken down due to technical difficulties.)</span></i></STRONG></em></p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/11/2014111111585325734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/Images/2014/11/11/2014111111585325734_20.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-15 19:10:13','Al Jazeera',0.00000000,0.00000000,NULL,NULL),(579,'2014111562016957147','http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2014/11/un-slashes-food-rations-refugees-kenya-2014111562016957147.html','UN slashes food rations for refugees in Kenya','Spokesman says last-resort measure has been prompted by five crises around the world that have stretched resources thin.','<p>The UN World Food Programme is to slash in half food rations for half a million refugees in Kenya as it scrambles for funding amid an unprecedented number of emergencies around the globe.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n<!--<DATA_FIELDS>article_quote,quoted_author,additional_info</DATA_FIELDS>--> </div>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Steve Taravella, a senior spokesman with the food agency, said the WFP was taking the last-resort measure in the wake of humanitarian crises in Syria, Iraq, South Sudan, Central African Republic and now West Africa with the Ebola outbreak.</p>\r\n<p>Taravella said WFP expected it would have to reduce rations like this in other places as resources are stretched thin.</p>\r\n<p>\"We really don\'t want to be doing this,\" he said. \"Telling hungry people they\'ll be receiving less food than they\'re accustomed to is never easy.\"</p>\r\n<p>As of Saturday, the 500,000 refugees in northern Kenya, most of them from South Sudan and Somalia, will receive a daily food ration of just over 1,000 calories, compared to the 2,100 calories a day they have been getting, through the end of January.<br /><br />That is when a United States food donation is expected to arrive, but that amount is expected to be enough for just six weeks.</p>\r\n<p>The WFP is trying to raise $38m to pay for its Kenya refugee operations for the next six months.</p>\r\n<p>This year has seen similar cuts elsewhere, notably in conflict-torn Syria and its neighbours, which have taken in millions of Syrian refugees.</p>\r\n<p>The announcement came as a convergence of droughts, harvest failures, locust invasions and political conflicts in Mali have left 4.75 million people without enough to eat, UN officials said.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>\'Not possible to help\'</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>UNICEF emergency director, Afshan Khan, said the children\'s agency estimates that almost one million children in the country are suffering from varying degrees of malnutrition - and close to half a million youngsters will suffer from acute malnutrition by the end of the year.</p>\r\n<p>John Ging, the director of UN humanitarian operations, warned that without an urgent infusion of additional funds \"we can expect that the situation will continue to deteriorate\".</p>\r\n<p>He said the UN had received $230 million of the $481m it needs for humanitarian aid for Mali - just 48 percent.</p>\r\n<p>The UN food agency has to rely on a patchwork of donor appeals and commitments.

Nicolas Sarkozy, made the remarks on Al Jazeera\'s <em>Head to Head</em> programme, which airs on November 14.</p>\r\n<p>This is the first time a senior French politician, and a former member of the government, has made such a public admission.</p>\r\n<p>Kouchner told <em>Head to Head</em>\'s Mehdi Hasan and the audience at the Oxford Union that although in Rwanda \"the French soldiers never killed anybody\", France had trained Rwandan soldiers \"for three years\", some of whom went on to perpetrate massacres.</p>\r\n<p><br />Kouchner, who witnessed the 1994 Rwandan genocide as a doctor there, said that later, as French foreign minister, he had \"done his duty\" towards the country by restarting relations and organising Sarkozy’s visit in February 2010, the first by a French president since the genocide.<br /> <br />Kouchner\'s comments come in the wake of increased tensions between Rwanda and France over the tragic events of twenty years ago.</p>\r\n<p>In an interview in April to Francois Soudan of <em>Jeune Afrique</em>, Rwandan President Paul Kagame blamed France directly for the killings, condemning the \"direct role of Belgium and France in the political preparation for the genocide and the participation of the latter in its very execution\".</p>\r\n<p>Whilst Belgium has apologised for its role, France never has.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Stand on Gaddafi

to meet Gaddafi\".</p>\r\n<p>Pressed by Hasan on why he remained part of the government if he was so opposed to the visit, Kouchner explained his decision as a \"contradiction in politics\".<br /> <br />Kouchner, who was head of the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, from 1999 to 2001, rebutted an the UK-based rights group Amnesty International\'s report of 2013 accusing UNMIK of failing “to investigate the abduction and murders of Kosovo Serbs in the aftermath of the 1998-1999 conflict\".</p>\r\n<p>\"Amnesty International was sitting on their ass\" while \"we were stopping a massacre\", he said.</p>\r\n<p>He defended the intervention in Kosovo as \"one of the UN\'s successes\".</p>\r\n<p>Discussing the concept of humanitarian intervention and the \"right to interfere\", Kouchner, who is considered one of the architects of the doctrine, said it is \"better to save one life than to do nothing,\" and that he is \"always on the side of the victims\".<br /> <br />Kouchner also said on <em>Head to Head</em> that he believes the \"UN Security Council needs reform\" to include more African, Latin American or Asian members, and to ensure the future of the Responsibility to

It seemed like something from <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>. And it proved to be just about as hard to reach as something in space, at least from a photographer\'s point of view, because the image of The Atomium is copyrighted by the estate of its designer, engineer Andre Waterkeyn.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p>I approached the marketing team at The Atomium and showed them some of my work, and they agreed to give me unlimited access. I was thrilled. But I only had three evenings and one weekend in which to shoot the time lapses. During the day, one really needs clouds and definition in the skies when shooting upwards. But the Saturday I was there was the hottest day on record in Belgium; great for sampling ice cream, not so good for time lapse. So I concentrated on the inside shots of visitors and the installations.</p>\r\n<p>On the Sunday, I awoke to fluffy white clouds. It was time to get moving. I only had one day to pull off the hardest shot, the opening shot, or \'hyperlapse\'.</p>\r\n<p>With warm weather and the weekend come tourists, and I was trying to ask Russians, Belgians, Germans, Italians and Chinese if they wouldn\'t mind stepping to one side as I hauled myself and my tripod and camera gear 300 moves at 30cm intervals over the lawn leading to The Atomium. It was tough. Really tough. It was like doing yoga and playing musical statues on an extremely hot day. I needed an ice cream after that one.</p>\r\n<p>Security opened a special ladder system for me, which is usually reserved for emergency escape from The Atomium. It is where the second shot is from. I spent about three hours up there. I\'d only intended to spend two hours, but the gate to the stairs had been locked behind me and I couldn\'t get anyone\'s attention to let me down again. I was starting to get a little worried. When I finally decided to climb over the gate, I discovered that the padlock was just hanging loose and I hadn\'t been trapped up there after all.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i> Dubai in black and white </i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>This is the fourth time lapse I\'ve made of Dubai and I wanted to try something a little different.</p>\r\n<p>Dubai has some great rooftop bars to shoot from, although many have now banned tripods, which are a must for most time lapse work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through friends and contacts, I was able to access some excellent locations. Height is key to megacity time lapses, and something I\'m yet to achieve fully here in Qatar.</p>\r\n<p>I shot every night on a two week, then on a subsequent three week trip to Dubai, producing about 15,000 still images. What people don\'t always realise is that to get what one might term \'professional\' images, one needs to shoot in \'RAW\' stills. True time lapse is not sped up video.</p>\r\n<p>Shooting every night in a climate like Dubai\'s, whilst carrying camera gear, on foot, is seriously tough going. I carried cans of energy drinks, water and jelly babies to keep me going.</p>\r\n<p>I am so passionate about time lapse but very often have no real time to research and prepare. Typically, I\'m a traveller with no transport and only Google maps and the internet as my friend, so location scouting is impossible. Instead I stop. I observe. I look up. If the architecture speaks to me in some way, I take out my camera and compose the shot.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAl Jazeera Correspondent can be seen each week at the following times GMT: Thursday: 2000; Friday: 1200; Saturday: 0100; Sunday: 0600; Monday: 2000; Tuesday: 1200; Wednesday: 0100; Thursday: 0600. <br />\r\n<p><a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://english.aljazeera.net/programmes/aljazeeracorrespondent/\"> Watch more Al Jazeera Correspondent  </a></p>\r\n<div></div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/14/201411149109871734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/Images/2014/11/14/201411149109871734_20.jpg',NULL,NULL,'2014-11-14 22:54:29','Al Jazeera',0.00000000,0.00000000,NULL,NULL),(602,'2014111403415547102','http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2014/11/burkina-faso-factions-approve-transition-plan-2014111403415547102.html','Burkina Faso factions approve transition plan','Army reaches deal with opposition, civil groups and religious leaders on blueprint to return country to civilian rule.','<p>Burkina Faso\'s army has reached an agreement with opposition parties, civil groups and religious leaders for a transition to civilian rule, almost two weeks after the ousting of President Blaise Compaore.</p>\r\n<p>The different factions \"unanimously voted\" in favour of a transition charter on Thursday, said Henry Ye, president of the commission representing the main power players in the West African country.</p>\r\n<p>\"Today was the day of compromise,\" said Herve Kam, a member of the Balai Citoyen civil society group. \"Both soldiers and civilians agree on a civilian transition.

After listening to the street chants for a day, I wrote \"Irhal\" (Leave!) in a fit of inspiration and began playing it for increasingly large crowds. Within a few days, it had spread across Tahrir, Egypt, and the world thanks to a video uploaded to YouTube. By the time Hosni Mubarak was forced from power, I had been transformed into a symbol of the revolutionary youth who toppled \"The Pharaoh\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The broad outlines of the story are true, but there is one very important piece of my history missing. I did not show up at Tahrir and write \"Irhal\" out of nowhere. I had been writing political songs for several years - songs that I\'d never had the chance to play in public until the revolution - to capture the anger, hopelessness, and yet, hope, of my generation. \"Irhal\" was the result of a long process of political development that I and so many of my peers had undergone in the previous years.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">After the January 25 revolution, music and politics were fused together for me, just like art and politics were for all the amazing artists who painted the murals on Muhammad Mahmoud Street. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>No better place to sing</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">There was something about Tahrir that was special, transcendent, even when there weren\'t many people, or it was pouring rain, or the police were shooting at us - there was no place I would have rather been at, and no better place to write a song.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Something changed, however, during the rule of Mohamed Morsi. Politics started to feel like it had under Mubarak. Revolutionaries were pushed from the political stage, and it became harder for me to practise my art, or spread a revolutionary message. After the Ittihadiyya protests of late 2012, when the Muslim Brotherhood actually fought alongside security and military forces against pro-democracy protesters, it was clear the revolution would have to rise up against Morsi. But what the millions of people who marched against Morsi didn\'t understand was that the military was not our friend.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Perhaps because I had felt the full force of the military\'s brutality when they tortured me in March 2011, and seeing so many of my friends and revolutionaries beaten, imprisoned, tortured and killed by the government, I never could trust the military to bring Egypt closer to democracy. And I knew that my job as an artist was to constantly remind my fellow Egyptians of this fact.<br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">That is why I couldn\'t simply support the Tamarrod <span>(a pro-military youth) </span>movement when they led the massive protests against Morsi. I could see Tahrir Square changing as the protests grew. It was no longer the Tahrir I knew. People didn\'t know the songs of the revolution, and they were supporting the military, and even the police - the group against whom the revolution started. As I feared, once Morsi was removed on July 3, Tahrir and Egypt became a very different place. It was not a revolutionary space - although I know it will be again. The victory of the counter-revolution was confirmed when 1,000 Egyptians were massacred by the government, with hardly any protest from Egyptians.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Revolutionary voices</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">By the summer of 2013, it was almost impossible for me to play anywhere. By the time the third anniversary of January 25 came around, there was very little space for any revolutionary voices. I could upload my music - and in fact new songs could get 100,000 views in a day - but I couldn\'t be with Egyptians, with my guitar, on the street, where I always felt most at home.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">I didn\'t have it the worst by any means, as so many friends and comrades had been arrested, jailed and awaiting trials. Journalists, bloggers, civil society activists - everyone was being targeted, and when their families would protest their illegal detention and mistreatment, the best they could hope for was for themselves to be arrested and held for trial too. This disaster was epitomised by the imprisonment of blogger and activist Alaa Abdel Fattah, and then his younger sister Sanaa Seif, during which time their father, the human rights pioneer Ahmed Seif, died.<br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">No matter what has happened, I refused to stop addressing social and political issues in my songs. As an artist and citizen, I feel an obligation to be engaged in my society and add to the democratic process. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Still, the situation has only become harder, and ultimately impossible for me as an artist. </span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">As important, because of travel restrictions imposed on me, I have also had to turn down offers for concerts and lectures abroad. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Dialogue</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Democracy is about dialogue. It is not about shutting down ideas or artistic expressions which may be in opposition to the majority or the ruling system. Due to restrictions and censorship, this dialogue is not possible in Egypt now. Nothing is more evident of this than the ongoing arrests and long-term imprisonment of young Egyptian activists, such as the 23 who were sentenced to three years in jail less than two weeks ago.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">In a situation where there is little room for revolutionary art, the Swedish city of Malmo generously offered me a two-year residence as artist. During my stay in Europe, I will continue to disagree with the government on many issues, including its oppression of university students, who have to live with constant harassment, monitoring and attacks on their campuses.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">I have just finished recording my first song in Sweden, \"Nashid at-toulab\" (The students\' anthem) to support the students as part of a new album of revolutionary songs. I will continue to write, perform, and reach out to artists and audiences in Europe and beyond to help my generation continue the struggle for freedom, inside and outside Egypt.

These included many public intellectuals and popular journalists as well as some of the country\'s \"social media active\" middle class, which made the anti-Ponta message that much more vocal in the public space.</p>\r\n<p>There are countless reasons to oppose Ponta and his party, which has been holding executive power since 2012. Over the past two years, the Social-Democrats have supported legislation that would give immunity to corrupt politicians, criminalise investigative journalism, and give extraordinary powers to corporations in the extractive sector.</p>\r\n<p>Ponta is notoriously unreliable: While in opposition, he criticised austerity only to implement IMF-dictated austerity measures once in power; before taking office, he opposed the Rosia Montana gold mining project that brought <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/11/stopping-europe-biggest-gold-mine-20131117102859516331.html\" target=\"_blank\">tens of thousands to the streets</a> in 2013, only to get behind it as soon as he became prime minister.</p>\r\n<p>And yet, in their electoral zeal, his opponents have gone too far. In the past few weeks, their rhetoric has gone as far as demonising his poor electorate, which does not bode well for Romania\'s political future.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>\'Down with the communists!\'</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>These elections mark the end of Traian Basescu\'s ten years of domination over political life in Romania; he is about to give up his presidential seat to his soon-to-be-elected successor. For the first time in a while, the centre-right electorate could leave battered and bruised Basescu behind and look to new candidates.</p>\r\n<p>In this context, two figures relatively fresh to national politics gathered most of these voters\' sympathy. One was Klaus Iohannis, a Romanian of German origin who has been enjoying long-term success as mayor of the city of Sibiu; he represents the Christian-Liberal Alliance made up of the two main centre-right parties. The other was Monica Macovei, a former justice minister credited with implementing the reforms needed to get Romania into the European Union; she ran as an independent.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The emergence of these two political figures came against the backdrop of a turbulent year. In 2013, some of the strongest protests in Romania\'s post-socialist history rocked the country and led to the indefinite postponement of a project to build a gold mine at Rosia Montana in Apuseni Mountains. During those demonstrations, many felt for the first time that they can and should make a difference in the political life of their country. For some, the presidential elections this year constituted a major opportunity to see an electoral expression of the street movement.</p>\r\n<p>This sentiment intensified the public debate around the presidential elections. And because centre-right opinion-makers were influential in framing the discussion, the centre-right vs socialists conflict has been presented as a clash between democrats vs communists, good vs evil, salvation vs doom.</p>\r\n<p>According to this narrative, Ponta\'s socialists are really the communists who destroyed the country before 1989 and whose corruption and retrograde views on the economy are now preventing Romania from modernising further and better integrating with the EU. The centre-right candidates, particularly Macovei and Iohannis, were presented as guarantors of a non-corrupt, well-functioning and truly European Romania.</p>\r\n<p>In the first round of the elections on November 2, Ponta got 40 percent of the votes (turnout was a little over 50 percent). Iohannis was the runner-up with 30 percent and will face Ponta in this Sunday\'s runoff. Other centre-right candidates, including Macovei, scored around 5 percent. There was no other candidate claiming to represent the left from a total of fourteen running, apart of Ponta and a representative of a virtually unknown old-style communist party who got 0.3 percent. </p>\r\n<p>The first round came with another reason to hate Ponta. Bureaucratic procedures and insufficient voting booths led to thousands of Romanians living abroad in Western Europe <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNYTSUdo0KY\" target=\"_blank\">not being able to vote</a>. Many saw this as a strategy of the socialists to exclude voters who would otherwise have voted for the centre-right (indeed, Romanians abroad voted mostly for Iohannis).</p>\r\n<p>Anti-Ponta protests in major Western European cities and in Romania ensued. In Romanian towns, thousands marched chanting \"Down with the communists!\" and recycling slogans form last year\'s Rosia Montana demos.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Blame the poor</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>A particularly worrying turn in the public debate took place as emotions escalated: Antipathy for Ponta turned into hatred for those voting for him. The main centre-right commentators insisted that educated Romanians from the west of the country voted for Iohannis, while uneducated people from poor towns and villages in the east voted for Ponta.</p>\r\n<p>A stark opposition was created between Iohannis voters who supposedly care for the rule of law and work hard to push the economy forward, and Ponta\'s electors who are allegedly interested only in getting social assistance and pre-electoral bribes (the Socialists\' dubious practice of making payments to teachers or distributing food right before elections was widely publicised). Some radical commentators even questioned the benefits of universal voting.</p>\r\n<p>Regardless of the practices of the socialists, the verbal violence with which some journalists and intellectuals turned against those who voted for this party was shocking. </p>\r\n<p>Ponta\'s presidential programme is the only one which pays some lip service to issues of social justice (though his so-called \"pro-business leftist\" programme bears uncanny resemblance to liberal Iohannis\' programme and is far from a serious leftist proposition). While social protection measures taken by Ponta are no more than patching up (marginal increases in public salaries and pensions, minor hikes in minimal wage), no other candidate speaks of anything else but further economic liberalisation and budgetary discipline.</p>\r\n<p>Iohannis\' vision of Romania centres on a liberalised, competitive economy where businesses thrive and education is geared towards technological progress. He addresses exclusively the winners of transition.</p>\r\n<p>But in Romania, one in five employees cannot make a living out of their salary and <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/People_at_risk_of_poverty_or_social_exclusion\" target=\"_blank\">40 percent of people</a> are at risk of poverty or social exclusion. Many have been further impoverished by <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://m.aljazeera.com/story/201211893834749122\" target=\"_blank\">austerity measures</a> implemented since 2008. In these conditions, it is not unreasonable that people fear politicians who promise more liberalisation of the economy and a minimalist state, the main line pursued by governments over the past decade and more.</p>\r\n<p>Ponta is a poor choice for Romania. But Iohannis is no dream proposition either. Not only does he speak only to the successful but, despite the current antagonism with Ponta, he was an ally of the socialists twice between 2009 and 2012, and his own party too is tainted by corruption.</p>\r\n<p>It is naive to think that if Ponta loses on Sunday, things will turn out fine. Not caring for the needs of a large part of the population is not only immoral but also unreasonable. We just need to look at other societies in the European Union to see what happens if poor people are ignored for too long. In Poland, Romania\'s model in the East, unemployed youth <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/11/cloneofburning-down-rainbow-poland-2013111293719-2013111343533605488.html\" target=\"_blank\">join the far-right</a>. In the UK, hopeless youth came out into the streets in uncontrollable riots in 2011.</p>\r\n<p>In 2013, Romanians from all social classes and of all political colours came together to fight against a mining project that would have meant the crushing of some poor villagers by a rich corporation supported by corrupted politicians from all parties. In 2014, protesters use the same slogans to support one politician against another while the poor and peasants are demonised for supposedly voting for the socialists.</p>\r\n<p>The 2014 protesters may mean well but, to be sure, most of them are just defending their own interests by promoting centre-right Iohannis. For any chance of a bright future in Romania, both the future president and Romanians themselves must resurrect another value learnt on the streets in 2013: solidarity.</p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i>Claudia Ciobanu is a freelance reporter based in Warsaw, contributing among others to <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.ipsnews.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Inter Press Service</a>  and <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"https://opendemocracy.net/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenDemocracy</a>.</i></STRONG></em></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i>Follow her on Twitter: <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"https://twitter.com/Claudia_Warsaw\" target=\"_blank\">@Claudia_Warsaw</a></i></STRONG></em></p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/images/2014/11/13//2014111314255146580_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/images/2014/11/13/2014111314255146580_20.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-14 20:58:47','Al Jazeera',45.79278400,24.15206900,NULL,NULL),(606,'20141113115243571874','http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/101east/2014/11/battling-dry-20141113115243571874.html','Battling the dry','101 East explores the human cost of the severe drought paralysing Australia’s north.','<p>The Australian state of Queensland is experiencing its worst drought on record.</p>\r\n<p>Some regions have had as little as five percent of their usual rainfall.

You have even more prejudices against Muslims than, for example, against Jews.\"</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Normal1\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Breaking a taboo</i></STRONG></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Normal1\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Muslims in Germany make up about five percent of the country\'s total population of 82 million, making them Germany\'s largest religious minority. Jews account for a little more than 0.1 percent of the country\'s population. Koschmieder, whose field of research includes both right-wing extremism and anti-Semitism, explained that public hate speech towards Jews is taboo in German society, or at least it was - until this summer.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Normal1\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\"They don\'t know or they don\'t care for this taboo,\" said Koschmieder of the pro-Palestinian protesters who shouted anti-Semitic slogans on the streets of Berlin. \"This taboo is more often challenged these days.\"</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Normal1\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The boundary between legitimate political criticism and projection of Jewish hatred are very narrow and easily crossed, according to Daniel Alter, a prominent rabbi in Berlin\'s Jewish community. Alter said most anti-Semitic acts were carried out by people with a Christian background - which was confirmed by Berlin police spokesperson Stefan Redlich. However, Alter added, the anti-Semitism of young Muslims much more openly perpetrates acts of hatred against Jews.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Normal1\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\"There are areas in Berlin in which it is definitely not wise if you are identifiable as a Jew,\" Alter said. \"Unfortunately, it is in the regions where young Muslim people congregate and hang out. If I pass by there, and if somebody can identify me as a Jew, I get at least verbally harassed.\"</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Normal1\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Two years ago, Alter was a victim of anti-Semitic violence. A group of young men of Arab descent <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/berlin-officials-express-outrage-over-attack-on-rabbi-a-852934.html\" target=\"_blank\">attacked</a> the rabbi on the street as he was walking with his seven-year-old daughter. They asked him if he was Jewish, and when he replied yes, they beat him up and threatened his daughter. He was hospitalised that evening with a fractured cheekbone.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Normal1\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>\'No-go areas\' in Berlin</i></STRONG></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Normal1\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Berlin police recorded eight other instances of anti-Semitic violence in 2013, and five since the beginning of 2014. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Normal1\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">In an interview last year with a German newspaper, Alter <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.morgenpost.de/berlin-aktuell/article119461331/Rabbiner-Alter-sieht-in-Berlin-No-Go-Areas-fuer-Juden.html\" target=\"_blank\">suggested</a> that parts of Neukoelln, a Berlin district with a large Muslim population, are \"no-go areas\" for Jews wearing visible religious symbols like the kippah because they would be under threat.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Normal1\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">That statement triggered Armin Langer, a 24-year-old Jewish resident of Neukoelln, to reach out to others in his neighbourhood. Langer co-founded the <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"https://salaamschalom.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Salaam-Schalom Initiative</a>, an inter-religious dialogue group whose members include Muslims, Jews, Christians and atheists.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Normal1\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The group meets on a regular basis in Neukoelln and organises community events, panels and open discussions - all aimed at creating direct communication between people from different religions and backgrounds.

It raised $21.8 million after targeting $15 million.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"We planted 5,000 hectares [in one year], the size of Manhattan,\" Sood, Feronia CEO, said in a phone interview. \"That is all manual, by hand - a staggering undertaking.

The World Championships in Doha starting on Friday will be the 23-year-old Egyptian’s first tournament as the world’s best.</p>\r\n<p>El Shorbagy shares his thoughts with Al Jazeera on what it\'s like to be on top of the world, his journey there and how he balances life between the squash court and a classroom.<br /> </p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>AJ: You are now the world’s top-ranked player. Is the journey complete?</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>El Shorbagy: As an athlete, you want to win everything, you never want to lose. Being world number one was one of the big goals for me. Some players think after getting here, you have reached the end of the ladder. For me, it’s just the first step. I want to stay here as long as I can and will work even harder to achieve that.</p>\r\n<p>Earlier, I was the hunter. Now I wake up being the hunted. It’s like that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><STRONG><i>AJ: So where do you want to see yourself before you retire?</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>El Shorbagy: I would love to win World Championships, British Opens. I already have the Hong Kong title, Qatar Classic and the US Open in my bag. But I want to win more. I want to win for as long as I can. I’m hungry for more and winning makes me hungrier. I’ll hopefully stay focussed and not going to let other players stop me from winning.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>AJ: So how did it all start for you then, you getting into squash?</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>El Shorbagy: My uncle played squash as an amateur. I used to be a swimmer but one day I went to the courts with him. My mother wanted me to concentrate on swimming, saying it was the right thing to do. Until I won my first squash nationals aged just 10 [an under-11 tournament]. That’s when she realised I can play squash and go forward. That’s when it all started for me.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>AJ: You’re quite keen on studying as well, having done a bachelor’s degree and now pursuing a master\'s course. How does that work with the time needed for training and participating in tournaments?</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i></i></STRONG>El Shorbagy: This master’s course is part-time so it gives me time to balance things. I’ve always felt, even during my bachelor’s degree, that I needed something different. It helps me with squash as well. If I play all the time, I’ll go mentally crazy with the travelling and everything. I need something different in my life and studying has given me that, making me the player I am today.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>AJ: So do you go crazy at times with so much happening?</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i></i></STRONG>El Shorbagy: I go crazy all the time! People see the squash player who I am on the court. They don’t see what happens off it. There’s so much going on. The amount of pressure, especially. We try and leave it all behind when we go on court so we can just focus on the next shot.</p>\r\n<p>For example, when I was playing Gaultier in the semi-finals of the US Open, I need to win that match to become world number one. I woke up that that morning and I was shaking. People don’t see that. I went onto the court that evening and I had to leave all that behind. There are times when you go into depression thinking about the times you’ve lost. And that’s what we got to go through and still turn up at their best.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>AJ: One type of pressure you won’t be facing any time soon is playing in the Olympics. You think squash should be there and has a chance to be there?</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>El Shorbagy: Anyone who knows the sport knows squash should be there. We still have a big chance of making it to the 2020 Olympics. There’s a meeting in December with the IOC and I know that the new president wants new sports. Good thing for me is that I’ll be 29 then. That’s the age that squash players normally peak at. I’m 23 right now and all my opponents are in their 30s. Age is on my side. Other have peaked. I’m number one and yet to peak. My best is still to come.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>AJ: There has also been a development that the men’s and women’s squash federations have merged. Is that good for the sport?</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>El Shorbagy: I believe in equal prize-money in all world series tournaments but I don’t agree with the merger. I believe there should be separate bodies with one that controls both. I believe that women’s tour needs to get stronger by themselves. But it’s something new, let’s see. Maybe it’ll work better for the sport. If it gets us into the Olympics then I believe the PSA has done the right thing.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>AJ: Are you satisfied with the prize-money that squash has to offer? It’s quite low compared to other individual sports out there.</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>El Shorbagy: It definitely needs a re-visit. The sport is doing much better than it was few years ago and the prize-money has increased. But I think it needs to be higher. The amount of physicality in this sport and the amount of injuries we get, it needs to increase. Players can be out for months. But the PSA is working hard towards this and doing a great job.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>AJ: Finally, Egypt is dominating the squash world. They have seven players in the top-17. Was the sport affected due to the revolution in Egypt and perhaps stopped more players from coming forward?</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>El Shorbagy: I don’t think individual sport suffered with the revolution in Egypt. But team sports, like football, did. For us, we can train anytime we want and need to. It did affect us little bit maybe financially but didn’t stop us from training or going to tournaments. And I firmly believe, just like other countries in the past, this is Egypt’s time to shine on the squash court.</p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/13//2014111315154865734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/13//2014111315154865734_2.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-14 02:51:06','Al Jazeera',25.28666700,51.53333300,NULL,NULL),(633,'20141113124433898954','http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2014/11/ukraine-truce-deal-peril-amid-new-tensions-20141113124433898954.html','Fears rise amid Ukraine truce breaches','Russia rejects claims it has been supporting rebels in Ukraine and says Kiev is responsible for breaking the ceasefire.','<p>The ceasefire in eastern Ukraine is all but dead, Ukraine\'s representative to the Organisation of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has told an Austrian newspaper.</p>\r\n<p>It was now barely possible to still speak of a ceasefire, Ihor Prokopchuk was quoted as telling<em> Die Presse</em> in an interview.</p>\r\n<p>\"Since the Minsk agreement ... we have more than 2,400 breaches of the ceasefire by militant groups.

Jerusalemite\'','When will the apartheid wall come down? ','<p>Twenty-five years ago, the Berlin Wall came down. John F Kennedy\'s famous speech \"I am a Berliner\" had made that wall the symbol of the West that embodies the \"other\" against which it fought for decades, justifying countless wars and dictatorships as well as internal repression. November 9, 1989 marked the end of the Cold War confrontation, and the Arab and Muslim populations became the new enemy.</p>\r\n<p>The year 2002 saw the construction of a new wall, much longer, much higher - a tool of large scale confiscation of land and resources and ethnic cleansing. The Israeli apartheid wall, built on occupied Palestinian land, effectively creates Bantustans, separating Palestinian farmers from their farmland, families from their relatives, and children from their schools. It makes a Palestinian state or self-determination impossible. Sadly, today, this wall is the very symbol of the \"free\" world\'s own paradigm: Under the cover of \"security\" and \"self-defence\", everything is justified.</p>\r\n<p>Jerusalem and Israel\'s apartheid Wall are the new symbolic battle field. There are no US airlifts or grandiose speeches, just the daily resistance against Israel\'s attempts to exclude Palestinians and their neighbourhoods from the city in order to annihilate Palestinian existence there and deny Palestinians Jerusalem as their capital.</p>\r\n<p>On November 7, clashes spread all across occupied East Jerusalem. In Shuafat refugee camp alone, dozens of people were injured. In Bir Nabala, the popular committee tore down a piece of the apartheid wall. Palestinians in Jerusalem aren\'t waiting for the international community to comply with their obligation to ensure Israel tears down the wall, as reaffirmed by the International Court of Justice in its 2004 verdict. Already, the protests in Jerusalem have spread to Palestinian citizens of Israel in the Galilee and throughout the West Bank. Today, is the moment for people worldwide to stand in solidarity, denouncing the connivance of their own political leadership, by stating \"I am a Jerusalemite.\"</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>The \'Jerusalem Intifada\'</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>Jerusalem has always been central in Israeli strategies. During its ethnic cleansing campaigns in 1948, the most cruel and emblematic massacre of Palestinian civilians occurred in Deir Yasin, on the outskirts of Jerusalem. Since the occupation of the eastern part of the city in 1967, Israel has worked relentlessly to annex all of Jerusalem and to erase Palestinian presence in the city. Lately, Israeli aggression in Jerusalem has risen exponentially.</p>\r\n<p>In the past two months, Israel announced over 3,600 new settlement housing units in and around Jerusalem, grabbing more Palestinian land for Jewish settlers. In the neighbourhood of Silwan, illegal settlers took over <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/israeli-settlers-over-25-homes-e-jerusalem-residents-224044530.html\" target=\"_blank\">25 Palestinian apartments</a>.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Adding to this, Israel has sparked the ire of the entire Muslim world by attacking the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the surrounding Noble Sanctuary compound. Over the last six months, the Israeli army and settlers, joined regularly by Israeli political leaders, have invaded the area almost daily. Israel now routinely closes the Noble Sanctuary to Palestinians in the morning hours. Muslim men under 50 and women under 40 are barred from entering Al-Aqsa.</p>\r\n<p>Those entering are forced to leave their ID cards and many are then called for Israeli police interrogation when exiting. For the first time since Salahuddin liberated Jerusalem from the crusaders, Israeli occupation forces twice completely closed down the Noble Sanctuary compound, even prohibiting the call to prayer. Across the entire city, Palestinians are intimidated by ever increasing Israeli police presence.</p>\r\n<p>Israel\'s onslaught on Jerusalem aims at not only complete dominance over the Palestinian capital and holy places, it also works in parallel with the effort to create a settlement corridor from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea in order to advance the Bantustanisation of the West Bank. This would be a further phase of Ariel Sharon\'s plan to \"disengage\" from all Palestinian ghettos trapped behind the apartheid wall while annexing the rest of the land and making any Palestinian self-determination impossible.</p>\r\n<p>In the hills that stretch from Jerusalem to the Jordan Valley, 46 Palestinian Bedouin communities are currently being ethnically cleansed. Simultaneously, projects are under way to open a tunnel from al Aizariya to Anata while closing the historic roads connecting the southern West Bank with the north. In June, the checkpoint north of Bethlehem was temporarily closed to those without a necessary permit as a test run for the isolation of southern West Bank.</p>\r\n<p>Confronted with this reality, Israeli repression serves only an internal discourse as politicians call for excessive force to rehabilitate their self-perception as an invincible power, especially after the military defeat this summer in Gaza. It does nothing to subdue Palestinian resistance.</p>\r\n<p>The daunting images of 16-year-old Mohammed Abu Khdair, who was abducted and burned alive by a group of Israeli settlers on June 2, triggered the current \"Jerusalem Intifada\". Only Israel\'s terrifying attack on Gaza was able to divert the anger and the protests in Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Galilee. Immediately after the massacre, they intensified again as Israel announced more settlement units and the confiscation of 4,000 dunums (400 hectares) of Palestinian land in occupied Jerusalem.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>A third Intifada?</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>It is no wonder that one of the widespread slogans in the protests in Jerusalem is \"Come on West Bank, for God\'s sake!\" While there are dozens of protests in the West Bank heating up, a full scale third Intifada has yet to erupt.</p>\r\n<p>One reason is that protesters in the West Bank in addition to Israeli repression, face the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) police forces prohibiting protests in areas under its control as part of a \"security coordination\" with Israel. The second obstacle is the lack of a united political leadership.</p>\r\n<p>The president of the PNA, Mahmoud Abbas, has repeatedly spoken out against a third Intifada. Palestinian political parties so far have not shown sufficient responsiveness to develop a national strategy of resistance that could capitalise politically on the sacrifices of an Intifada. After the First Intifada that resulted in the Oslo Accords and the Second Intifada, which led to a strengthening of neoliberal and pro-US currents in the PNA, Palestinians are rightly sceptical over the possible political outcomes of another Intifada without the necessary leadership.</p>\r\n<p>The most strategic calls of the Palestinian struggle today are coming from the streets: Support for the resistance and the rights of the Palestinian people in Jerusalem, accession to the Rome Statute to bring Israeli war criminals to trial and an immediate end to \"security cooperation\" between the PNA and Israel. Those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity have to be held accountable.</p>\r\n<p>This simple three point agenda being developed in the streets of Palestine seems to have more potential to break the current stalemate of repression and build a solid basis for the inevitable outbreak of a third Intifada than the diplomatic projects of the Palestinian and the world\'s leadership.</p>\r\n<p>It\'s time for all of us, in Palestine and across the globe, to assert \"We are all Jerusalemites.\"</p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i>Jamal Juma is the general coordinator of the <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.stopthewall.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Stop the Wall Campaign</a>.</i></STRONG></em></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i>Maren Mantovani is coordinator of international relations of the <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.stopthewall.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Stop the Wall Campaign</a>. </i></STRONG></em></p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/images/2014/11/12//2014111212502287734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/images/2014/11/12/2014111212502287734_20.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-14 00:17:51','Al Jazeera',31.76831900,35.21371000,NULL,NULL),(638,'20141112103245331194','http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/11/africa-doesn-want-any-more-we-20141112103245331194.html','Africa doesn\'t want any more western band aids ','Africans still associate it with a dark period - humanity and dignity were trumped by sensationalist humanitarianism.','<p>Bob Geldof is to re-record Band Aid\'s \"Do they know it\'s Christmas?\" the 1984 charity anthem that mobilised resources for a famine that devastated parts of northern Ethiopia and present day Eritrea between 1983 and 1985. </p>\r\n<p>He has again brought together famous friends such as One Direction, Bono, and Chris Martin of Coldplay for what is, remarkably, the song\'s fourth revival. This time, Geldof says he hopes to raise resources to fight Ebola. On the surface that seems like an act of goodwill, so what\'s wrong with it? Plenty.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>A distorted image of victimhood</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>Band Aid, and the related Live Aid concerts, <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_4100000/newsid_4101800/4101879.stm\" target=\"_blank\">raised over $100m</a> for the Ethiopian famine victims. They galvanised a public that had largely been indifferent, marking a watershed for how celebrities engaged with humanitarian issues and how organisations conducted fundraising appeals. However, <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.metrolyrics.com/do-they-know-its-christmas-lyrics-band-aid.html\" target=\"_blank\">with unfounded and inaccurate lyrics</a>, the Christmas song not only created misconceptions about Ethiopia, but it did so in a patronising way.</p>\r\n<p>Despite the fact the famine was localised to northern Ethiopia and a result of political manipulation, the songs, concerts, and fundraising appeals perpetuated a single, negative, and distorted view of Ethiopia, making it synonymous with famine, poverty, and desperation.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The Band Aid and Live Aid campaigns left Ethiopia with a stigma that Ethiopians and Africans carry to this day. In fact, according to a <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.eldis.org/vfile/upload/1/document/0708/DOC1830.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2001 research study</a> on the legacy of Live Aid, 80 percent of British citizens associate the developing world with poverty, hunger and need. This type of stigma doesn\'t just leave Africans with a public relations problem; it can have broader implications for tourism, investments and other opportunities necessary for self-governance and autonomy.</p>\r\n<p>While the historical context described above is important to understanding the strong reactions against #BandAid30, the problem also lies in its detachment from reality today. Africa and African countries have changed. Whereas in 1985, Ethiopians, under a repressive, communist regime, were not able to organise, Liberians, Sierra Leoneans, and Guineans have been responding to Ebola since the beginning of the outbreak in March.  </p>\r\n<p>Community institutions and civil society organisations in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea have temporarily suspended all their non-Ebola programmes, launched aggressive education campaigns, built temporary holding centres, and taken care of children and families affected by Ebola. They are not helpless victims waiting for western saviours. They can, however, benefit from support and solidarity in the form of financial and technical resources.</p>\r\n<p>While African governments and philanthropists were slow to respond at first, there has been a growing crescendo of giving for Ebola.<a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/faraigundan/2014/11/10/billionaires-aliko-dangote-strive-masiyiwa-patrice-motsepe-join-fight-against-ebola/\" target=\"_blank\"> Three of Africa\'s richest men</a>, Patrice Motsepe, Aliko Dangote, and Tony Elumelu, have given $1m, $800,000 and $600,000 respectively, and on November 8, the <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://saharareporters.com/2014/11/10/african-union-steps-its-financial-support-victims-ebola-outbreak-following-criticism\" target=\"_blank\">African Union pushed the private sector</a> to give over $28.5m in pledges.</p>\r\n<p>The African diaspora has also taken it upon itself to act as an intermediary of resources and knowledge with initiatives like <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.lunchboxgift.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lunchbox</a> and Africa Responds. The latter aims to mobilise resources to support local organisations that are fighting Ebola on the ground, ensuring communities that are affected by Ebola are able to overcome the outbreak through their own efforts.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>New lyrics</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>Still, there is something commendable about Geldof adding his voice to the Ebola response. Compared to other humanitarian emergencies, the <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/ebola-fundraising-suffers-in-hierarchy-of-disasters-1.2768061\" target=\"_blank\">fight against Ebola is severely underfunded</a>. However, a song that is a model of bad aid should not have been recycled. With plans to record the new version on November 15, the ship has certainly sailed.</p>\r\n<p>Let\'s hope, at the very least, that he will heed the constructive criticism that #BandAid30 has received and improve the message in the song\'s latest reincarnation. For a start, it would be great if he could get African artists - especially those from affected countries - into the recording booth as well.</p>\r\n<p>Geldof has declared his intention to tweak the lyrics, but they need a complete overhaul. He says the proceeds will go to charity, but he should allocate at least a portion for indigenous organisations that are at the forefront of the fight against Ebola. This would be a bold move in a world that still favours international organisations when it comes to responding to Africa\'s emergencies.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Band Aid is a relic of an old era that patronised Africa. Clearly, many Africans still associate it with a dark period in which our humanity, dignity and agency were trumped by sensationalist humanitarianism. We now know that there are more effective ways of responding to emergencies, and a central part of that is supporting and strengthening the local response. Africans are now more connected to each other, and to the rest of the world, than at any other time in history.</span></p>\r\n<p>Put simply, 30 years on, African countries have changed.</p>\r\n<p>So should Geldof\'s song. </p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i>Solome Lemma is cofounder of <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://africansinthediaspora.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Africans in the Diaspora</a> and <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://africaresponds.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Africa Responds</a>.</i></STRONG></em></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i>Follow her on Twitter: <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"https://twitter.com/InnovateAfrica\" target=\"_blank\">@InnovateAfrica</a></i></STRONG></em></p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/images/2014/11/12//2014111212344034580_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/images/2014/11/12/2014111212344034580_20.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-14 00:17:31','Al Jazeera',9.14500000,40.48967300,NULL,NULL),(639,'201411911737464684','http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/11/muslims-feel-under-siege-kenya-201411911737464684.html','Muslims feel under siege in Kenya','Young Kenyan Muslims must be given alternatives beyond a life of relative deprivation or a false dream of eternal glory.','<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\">Last month, an imam at a Mombasa mosque was forced to step down by young al-Shabab sympathisers, and just last week a Muslim cleric, Sheikh Salim Bakari Mwarangi, was gunned down by two men on a motorbike. His murder has underlined a dichotomy within Kenya\'s Muslim community. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\">There are those, especially among the youth, who directly or indirectly support the Somali-based armed group al-Shabab; while others actively work to eradicate extremism within their religious and social milieu. In the latter group there are individuals who oppose al-Shabab and its ilk, but are also openly critical of the Kenyan government and what they view as its discrimination against Muslims. Both the pro-Shabab and anti-Shabab groups include clerics and Islamic scholars as well as ordinary citizens. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\">Kenya\'s coastal tourist region, which is home to many Muslims, has recently been targeted by a spate of bomb attacks linked to al-Shabab; and Mwarangi\'s death is the latest of several murders of Muslim clerics on both sides of the divide. In April, Imam Abubakar Shariff (aka Makaburi), known for his <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/04/feeding-grievances-killing-mak-2014411151431791922.html\" target=\"_blank\">scathing views on the government\'s approach to Muslims</a> and regarded as pro-Shabab, was killed by unknown assailants. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\">Then in June, another imam, Sheik Mohammed Idris, was shot after receiving death threats from extremist youths because he urged police to arrest them after they disrupted prayers at his mosque. Both Mwarangi and Idris are described by associates as peace activists but were deemed traitors by the youths.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\"><STRONG><i>Threat inside Kenya</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\">That al-Shabab is currently a threat inside Kenya is patently true. Insiders confirm that indigenous Kenyans constitute the largest non-Somali contingent within the organisation; and al-Shabab\'s present emasculation within Somalia may be a factor behind its recent upsurge of activity on Kenyan soil. The economic, political, and social marginalisation of Kenyan Muslims and Muslim areas in Kenya has provoked widespread resentment and frustration within that community; some of their grievances are detailed in the forthcoming <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/article-175282/muslims-plan-boycott-dinner-state-house\" target=\"_blank\">Sharawe Report</a>. Such grievances provide a fertile incubator for radical militancy, especially among unemployed and disaffected youth. </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\">A 2011 UN Monitoring Group report detailed how the Muslim Youth Centre (MYC), which began as a community organisation and rights forum to articulate the social, economic and religious peripheralisation of the youth of Majengo in the slum of Pumwani on the outskirts of Nairobi, evolved into an al-Shabab recruitment agency.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\">It\'s quite a stretch from optimistically operating Majengo\'s first library, nursery school and orphan feeding scheme to recruiting and financing terrorists. But despair and frustration in the face of perceived discrimination and disinterest can harden idealism and radicalise activists, especially when combined with literal interpretations of religious texts that promise alluring rewards in the afterlife. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\">That some politicians, securocrats and the media have tended to conflate al-Shabab with entire communities (all Muslims and/or all Somalis) has also exacerbated the situation and further alienated many Kenyan Muslims. It is extremely dangerous for politicians to manipulate fears over terrorism to demonise opponents, particularly when there are increasing incidents of xenophobia within a society. President Uhuru Kenyatta\'s fingering of his political opponents for the June 2014 Poromoko massacre is a case in point, especially since al-Shabab had claimed responsibility.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\">Moreover, heavy-handed police tactics such as mass-roundups of young men at mosques, have only served to reinforce perceptions of prejudice against Muslims by the anti-terrorism police. Counterterrorism operations such as Usalama Watch, launched by the security forces in April 2014, appeared to indiscriminately target Kenya\'s Somali population, regardless of age or affiliation, with reports of human rights violations being documented by Amnesty International, among others.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\">Yet until October 2011, when the Kenyan Defence Force launched Operation \"Linda Nchi\" (Swahili for \"Protect the Nation\") into Somalia following several cross-border kidnappings that the government attributed to al-Shabab, the latter had not carried out any large scale attacks in Kenya, with its leadership probably calculating that this was not in their best interests. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\"><STRONG><i>Pivotal incident</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\">After Linda Nchi was launched and with the subsequent absorption of the Kenyan troops into the multi-country African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), al-Shabab has staged various attacks in Kenya, most notably the prolonged <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/09/mysteries-linger-over-westgate--201492171737803205.html\" target=\"_blank\">attack on Nairobi\'s Westgate Mall</a> in September 2013.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\">For many Kenyans, Westgate was a pivotal incident, in much the same way as 9/11 was for Americans. The escalation of fear and outrage hardened anti-Muslim and anti-Somali perceptions among many Kenyans; while Kenyan Muslims increasingly felt they were under siege and being unfairly tarred with the taint of radicalism. Both sets of attitudes have continued to feed on each other in a vicious and unending cycle. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\"><a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.issafrica.org/uploads/Paper265.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Anneli Botha of the Institute for Security Studies,</a> who interviewed dozens of Kenyan militant youths, notes that \"when asked to clarify [what] finally pushed them over the edge, the majority … referred to injustices at the hands of Kenyan security forces, specifically referring to \'collective punishment\'.\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\">She argues that tactics such as mass arrests, racial profiling and extrajudicial killings have radicalised dozens, if not hundreds, of individuals to ensure a new wave of radicalism and collective resolve among groups such as al-Shabab. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\">Policy makers in Kenya need to take note and act fast.

To catch up with it, Rosetta used the gravity of Earth and Mars to effectively sling-shot itself into the comet’s orbit.</p>\r\n<p>It started its close approach to the 4km-wide comet in August. Since then it has been taking pictures and sampling the dust and gases emitted from the comet. This information has allowed scientists to decide where to attempt to land the smaller<em> Philae lander</em>.<br /> <br />The ESA team chose a flat, boulder-free area, with good sunlight which is needed to power Philae’s solar panels. The location was also visible from Rosetta, which the team plan to keep in orbit around the comet and which operates as a relay station for communications with the lander.</p>\r\n<p>But 67P has very little gravity. This means landing <em>Philae</em> from 22 kilometers above, with little control, and keeping the probe on its surface requires special technology.</p>\r\n<p>\"There is a risk that the <em>Philea lander</em> will bounce back,\" said Francisco Diego, Senior Research Fellow at the Department of Physics and Astronomy University College London. \"So the three legs have shock absorbers, and instantly, as it touches down, [it] deploys a harpoon with the tether, that make sure the lander remains attached to the surface of the comet.\"<br /> <br />The<em> Philae lander</em> has ten scientific instruments on board, including spectrometers to analyse chemical composition, and other instruments to examine the strength, density, texture, porosity and thermal properties of the comet. It also has a drill which can take samples from up to 23cm below the surface.</p>\r\n<p>\"We know that the surface of the comet is covered by interplanetary dust,\" said Diego. \"But inside we have the pristine material from which the solar system was formed.\"</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Back in time</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>The rocks that make 67P are believed to pre-date the formation of our solar system. This is why scientists are so interested in examining them.</p>\r\n<p>\"When comets come past the Earth we are always interested in taking a look at the gases that are coming out of them and the chemistry of them – a very primitive primordial chemistry,\" said Chris Riley, of the University of Lincoln. \"In this case we are going to get really close and even sample a comet for the first time and do the measurements in situ. So it’s a trip back in time, back four and a half billion years to the birth of the solar system.\"</p>\r\n<p>Scientists are also eager to examine the comet to see what whether the water it carries is similar to that found on Earth. They have suggested much of the water on Earth came from comets and with it came complex organic molecules, including amino acids, the building blocks of proteins.</p>\r\n<p>They hope the discoveries made on 67P will give clues into the origin and evolution of not just the Solar system, but also of life on Earth.</p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/11/2014111120249338580_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/Images/2014/11/11/2014111120249338580_20.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-12 23:39:17','Tarek Bazley',0.00000000,0.00000000,NULL,NULL),(685,'2014111164634312160','http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/11/african-answers-ebola-2014111164634312160.html','African answers to Ebola','Africa\'s private sector brings capabilities that are not available in other institutions to the fight against Ebola.

This includes teams of doctors, nurses, epidemiologists, lab technicians and the necessary support staff. In addition, the health workers need functioning equipment.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The complexity and scale of such an operation is qualitatively different from activities such as food relief. It therefore requires careful planning and systematic execution in regions with limited functioning basic or medical infrastructure.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Funding is only part of the resources needed to deploy the health workers. The bulk of the needs include training health workers, sourcing medical supplies, providing logistical support and extending insurance cover for volunteers.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">To bring in different competencies, the chairperson of the African Union, Dr Nkozasana Dlamini-Zuma, convened the November 8 Africa Business Round-table on Ebola in Addis Ababa. The round-table were Dr Donald round-table, president of the African Development Bank, and Dr Carlos Lopes, executive secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Limits exposed</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Africa has historically relied on government agencies and civil society to respond to emergencies, but the Ebola outbreak in West Africa has exposed the limits of this model. The initial response to the outbreak was sluggish, poorly funded and suffered from serious logistical challenges. Government actions to contain the outbreak by stopping flights backfired as no supplies could reach the affected areas. </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Many observers have argued that reductions in funding accounted for the <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/17/world-health-organisation-botched-ebola-outbreak\" target=\"_blank\">catastrophic failure</a> of the World Health Organization (WHO) to contain the outbreak. This may be true but the real issue is that the scale of operations needed to safeguard public health in any country cannot be outsourced to international organisations. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">These entities do not have analytical, technical, financial, logistical, and organisational capabilities to do the job. The private sector does.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Right from the outset the private sector insisted on a clear goal around which to rally support. The fact that the African Union is headed by a medical doctor brought unique technical expertise to the assessment of the needs. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Dr Dlamini-Zuma insisted on the urgency to train and deploy health workers through established government machinery. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\"We can, we must and will defeat Ebola, but we must also do more and do it faster,\" she said.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Leadership in mobilising private sector engagement was provided by Strive Masiyiwa, founder of the global telecommunications firm Econet Wireless. The roundtable was attended by CEOs from a wide spectrum of industries covering banking, telecommunications, mining, energy, and services.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Commitment to long-term response</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">By the time of the meeting, considerable groundwork had been done. Probably the most important aspect of the roundtable was a commitment by the participants to a long-term response to the Ebola crisis. The pledges were only the beginning of process that will include the economic reconstruction of the affected countries. The roundtable will become an annual African Union event focused on strengthening cooperation between government and the private sector.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The fund is established under the auspices of the African Union Foundation and will be managed by the African Development Bank. A governing body is being set up to oversee the operations of the fund. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The long-term approach taken by the private sector includes a pledge to support the creation of a research institute on infectious diseases. This pledge opens up opportunities to extend cooperation to universities and other research institutes. The circle of interactions will, in the future, include government, enterprises and academia with a focus on problem-solving. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The roundtable also expressed concern over the impact of stigmatisation on economic recovery. As Lopes noted, stigmatisation \"is hurting not just those suffering from Ebola, but the continent as a whole\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">But he also offered an optimistic outlook by noting that West Africa\'s growth continues to be robust despite the outbreak. The sub-region recorded the highest growth rate of any part of Africa in 2013, and is projected to remain above 6 percent.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The whole of West Africa accounts for close to a third of Africa\'s GDP with the three affected countries representing less than 1 percent.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\"In fact, even if all the three countries were to register zero growth it would dent only 0.19 percent of the West African GDP and 0.05 percent of Africa as a whole,\" Lopes noted.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The overall mood of at the round-table was about Africa taking ownership and remaining optimistic. As Dr Kaberuka said: \"Ebola is first and foremost our problem. Before relying on international aid, we must first encourage Africans to take action.\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Though tragic, Ebola has forced Africa to rediscover its own inner capabilities and find novel ways of harnessing it. The way ahead will involve closer interactions between government, business and academia.

Between 1900 and 1970, about 1,500 children of Roma travellers were placed in foster homes. Women on the outskirts of society were sterilised by force. The group was especially exposed under the country\'s former begging ban, the vagrant law of 1900, introduced when Norway was one of the poorest countries in Europe.

Russia\'s newly bachelor president, Vladimir Putin, (once again) caught the global attention - and sent Chinese censors into a hyperactive mode - when he <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/572329/20141111/apec-summit-2014-vladimir-putin-hits-chinese.htm\" target=\"_blank\">allegedly flirted</a> with China\'s first lady, Peng Liyuan, by suavely slipping a shawl over her shoulders. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-PH\">Meanwhile, Australia\'s conservative Prime Minister Tony Abbott, a fierce critic of Putin over the crisis in Ukraine, studiously avoided making eye contact with his Russian counterpart. Amid a bitter territorial dispute in the South China Sea, China\'s leader, Xi Jinping, in turn, showed little interest in holding an informal talk with his Filipino counterpart, Benigno Aquino, who will host next year\'s APEC summit. The Philippines is the only country to have <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.pca-cpa.org/showpage.asp?pag_id=1529\" target=\"_blank\">filed a legal complaint</a> against China\'s perceived maritime expansionism. The two leaders are yet to hold a single formal bilateral meeting. It was a game of cat-and-mouse among leaders in attendance. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-PH\">The highlight of the event, however, was the historic meeting between Xi and his Japanese counterpart, Shinzo Abe. By all means, it was an awkward meeting. Traditionally, Chinese leaders are expected to wait for and warmly welcome their guests, with beaming smiles and fierce handshakes adding to the overall festivity. This was precisely how Abe met Xi\'s predecessor, Hu Jintao, back in 2006. This time, the Japanese leader, forlorn and anxious, waited for his Chinese host to arrive at Beijing\'s Great Hall of the People. What followed were cold handshakes, no smiles, and a stiff, sullen facial expression on Xi\'s face. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-PH\"><STRONG><i>Bitter rivals</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-PH\">For centuries, China and Japan have been bitter rivals in Asia. And recent years have seen a dangerous spike in territorial tensions, with Beijing and Tokyo risking an all-out conflict over seemingly inconsequential features, the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, in the East China Sea. For months, Abe struggled to secure a formal meeting with Xi, who eventually relented. To appease his Chinese counterpart, Abe reiterated Japan\'s long-standing apology over its historical atrocities against China, called for broader bilateral diplomatic engagement, and the preservation of high-stake bilateral trade and investment ties. </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-PH\">It was clear that both sides acknowledged the importance of focusing on bilateral economic ties, establishing crisis-management mechanisms to avoid military conflict over their territorial disputes, and resume institutionalised dialogue between their relevant bureaucratic agencies. The meeting was a much-needed icebreaker in Sino-Japanese relations.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-PH\">Hosted by Beijing, the gathering served as a coming out party for Xi, widely seen as the <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/11/xi-chinese-dream-201411610557134765.html\" target=\"_blank\">most powerful Chinese leader since Deng Xiaoping</a>, who has vowed to restore his country to its historical glory - as the centre of the East Asian order. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-PH\">For more than a year, Xi has ferociously sought to consolidate power at home, purging low- and high-level enemies, placing himself at the centre of all major domestic reforms, and striking fear into the fabric of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) by launching an unprecedented anti-corruption crackdown. More confident than ever, Xi utilised the summit to highlight China\'s emergence as the pre-eminent economic power in Asia, proposing the establishment of the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP), which was widely welcomed by almost all leaders from across the region. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-PH\">Since China is already the biggest trading partner of almost all countries in the region, Xi\'s proposed FTAAP would simply streamline and integrate existing bilateral free trade agreements - between China and its major trading partners - into an overarching pan-regional network. But with global heavyweights such as China and the US in attendance, there was bound to be some disagreement in the room. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-PH\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-PH\"><STRONG><i>Clash of titans</i></STRONG> </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-PH\">Reeling from a <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/11/obama-foreign-policy-after-midte-20141157357537430.html\" target=\"_blank\">devastating midterm elections</a> at home, which saw the Republican opposition securing a majority in both houses of the US Congress, President Barack Obama tried to project strength and called upon China to underwrite - rather than undermine - the liberal international order.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-PH\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-PH\">In Washington\'s view, China has actively sought to challenge the US-led regional order. In recent decades, China has been creating alternative regional and international platforms, such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA), the New Development Bank (NDB), and the newly inaugurated Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), which aims to provide large-scale capital and technology for infrastructure projects in neighbouring countries. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-PH\">The US and its allies are not full-fledged members in the SCO and the CICA, while the NDB is an initiative of Brazil, India, Russia, China, and South Africa. The AIIB\'s inauguration ceremony was boycotted by Washington\'s top allies in the region, namely Japan, South Korea, and Australia. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-PH\">Now, if the China-proposed free trade area is actualised, it would render the Washington-led Trans-Pacific Partnership Free Trade Agreement (TPP) gratuitous. The TPP, a cornerstone of the Obama administration\'s Pivot to Asia policy, has been hobbled by a deadlock in negotiations. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-PH\">So far, it seems that China has managed to pull off a colourful event, with the APEC summit hosting a historic meeting between Asia\'s two most powerful states. The event also underlined how China has become the most consequential economic player in the region. It remains to be seen how the US will try to retain its leadership position in Asia. </span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-PH\">Richard Javad Heydarian is a specialist in Asian geopolitical/economic affairs and author of \"How Capitalism Failed the Arab World: The Economic Roots and Precarious Future of the Middle East Uprisings.\"</span></i></STRONG></em></p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/images/2014/11/11//2014111113303451734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/images/2014/11/11/2014111113303451734_20.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-12 19:08:23','Al Jazeera',39.90421100,116.40739500,NULL,NULL),(699,'201411125444618438','http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2014/11/myanmar-hosts-world-leaders-asean-summit-201411125444618438.html','Myanmar hosts world leaders for ASEAN summit','US president Barack Obama joins regional leaders for 25th ASEAN session amid territorial disputes over South China Sea.','<p>Myanmar prepares to welcome world leaders as it hosts the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit for the first time since the country began introducing political reforms nearly four years ago.</p>\r\n<p>US President Barack Obama, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe and Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang will join ASEAN leaders in the capital Naypyidaw for the crucial meet that comes amid territorial disputes in the South China Sea.</p>\r\n<p>Fresh discussions on a festering regional maritime row in the South China Sea are likely to be aired, with Southeast Asian nations including Vietnam and the Philippines looking for US support in their claims to waters contested with regional powerhouse China.</p>\r\n<p>The sea route is of tremendous strategic importance to everyone, including Washington, as a third of the world\'s shipping transits through the contested sea.

In this time, questions have been asked as to why the US has avoided targeting and killing Baghdadi or other high profile leaders of ISIL, otherwise known as a \"<a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/11/05/why_can_t_the_pentagon_kill_the_islamic_state_s_top_commanders\" target=\"_blank\">decapitation strike</a>\". </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">First, the founder of the group that would evolve into ISIL, the Jordanian Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was killed in an air strike in 2006, but the success in targeting Zarqawi in this case was based on local intelligence on the ground, and a long painstaking intelligence gathering effort. It appears that the US and the Iraqi state do not have such an intelligence network to successfully target Baghdadi. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">However, the attention generated by these rumours over the last weekend should generate an even more pressing question: Will ISIL and the \"Islamic State\" survive the death of its caliph if he is killed in the future? Furthermore, if the reports of <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/iraqi-forces-close-beiji-20141111131541430331.html\" target=\"_blank\">Iraqi forces in control of the town of Baiji</a> are confirmed, they will be in a position to make a move against the oil refinery in ISIL\'s control. Will ISIL survive as it continues to lose territory in Iraq, particularly its lucrative oil facilities? </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Tenacious</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">ISIL will prove to be tenacious, and the answer as to why has to do with its declaration of an Islamic State in the summer of 2014. Changing its name to the Islamic State was not merely a ploy in semantics. The declaration of the Islamic State was to prove that it had achieved what al-Qaeda failed to do. ISIL had been transformed from a terrorist group, led by a charismatic leader, to a terrorist group administrating territory. That transformation is what represented its final break from al-Qaeda, an organisation devoted to conducting spectacular acts of violence. The Islamic State was devoted to conducting banal acts of governance in conjunction with spectacular acts of violence, such as beheadings. </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">ISIL\'s legitimacy derives from its ability to project the trappings of statehood. It has used its media to brandish is credentials of statehood by establishing a bureaucracy, courts, an educational system and taxation. It seeks a monopoly on the use of organised violence in the area it controls. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">This includes eliminating dissident tribes that could raise arms against the Islamic State, which explains the recent <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/isil-kills-scores-iraqi-province-201411352753112457.html\" target=\"_blank\">massacres of members of the Albu Nimr tribe</a>. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">It has paradoxically sought to create a homogeneous, transnational nation of believing Muslims by destroying the heterogeneity of the north of Iraq, which explains its mass expulsions of Iraqi Christians and Yazidis.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">All that the Islamic State lacks is the legitimacy derived from mutual international recognition by other states, which it never sought in the first place. It also realised that states in the Muslims world resist its declaration of the Caliphate. Its legitimacy emerges from declaring a Caliphate and a state apparatus to sustain it, thus deriving legitimacy from a small, but devoted core of Muslims around the world, willing to leave their lives behind to travel and become citizens of the new Islamic State. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Baghdadi\'s charisma</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The charisma of Baghdadi has been channelled into a state structure that controls territory. His death in the future will not have a likely impact on the stable succession of a new caliphate based on past precedents. Even in its days when it lacked a state apparatus, the terrorist organisation that was the progenitor of the Islamic State demonstrated that it could handle the death of their leader and ensure a relatively stable succession.</span></p>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Al-Qaeda in Iraq survived after Zarqawi was killed in 2006, and he was replaced by Abu Umar al-Baghdadi, and in April 2010 he was killed in a military strike. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was his replacement, demonstrating that this group has had an organisational history of ensuring smooth transitions of leadership. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">A targeted assassination of Baghdadi will not spell the end of the Islamic State or even a defeat. His death will propel him into the pantheon of its martyrs, along with Zarqawi. However, contemplating this scenario also begs another question: Who could serve as the potential successor of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to ensure this transition?</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> The <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/iraq-war-on-terror/rise-of-isis/who-runs-the-islamic-state/\" target=\"_blank\">command structure of ISIL</a> indicates a high preponderance of Iraqis in leadership positions, including veterans of the Iraqi military under the Baathist rule. They are all relatively obscure figures, but so was Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The Iraqi leadership of ISIL also serves as a quiet coup of the old guard from the Saddam Hussein government, where they found an effective structure to reassert their power. The death of Baghdadi would be a symbolic defeat for the Islamic State, but might be a tangible victory for the former officers of the Iraqi military. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">If ISIL\'s viability rests on its ability to deliver a state, making the death of Baghdadi irrelevant to its organisational success, what if that state began to unravel, either due to pressure from a sustained military campaign, the loss of its ability to charge rents from local Iraqis and the oil industry, or even armed resistance from local communities?</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Promises delivered</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">For that scenario to occur, the Iraqi state would have to recapture Mosul, which does not seem likely in the near term given the difficulty the new Iraqi military has had in waging urban combat. If one projects even farther in the future, what if ISIL lost all urban centres it controlled, including its de-facto capital in Raqqa, back in Syria? Even in that scenario it would not diminish the appeal of the Islamic State. Even when the group was on the run from 2008 to 2011, it branded itself an Islamic State. In those days, it promised that is was a vanguard to establish an Islamic State. In 2014, it delivered on that promise. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Second, expelling the Islamic State from its urban centres will not happen anytime soon. In the meanwhile, the Islamic State would have existed anywhere from a year to three years. That would be enough to give ISIL\'s followers, the former citizens of the Islamic State, a tangible experience, demonstrating that an Islamic state under a caliph, which had only existed as a theory promised by al-Qaeda, could be established in the 21st century. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">ISIL followers would have a reason to continue to fight to restore a former golden age. This is not the Golden Age of the Abbasid Caliphate, but the golden age of a Caliphate they created in their lifetime. This nostalgic era would have further been undermined by a coalition of western nations, comprador Sunni Muslim regimes, and three Shia-led governments in Iraq, Syria, and Iran. In defeat, they would have developed a narrative that they had established an Islamic State despite the vast array of enemies against it, and if they did it once, they could do it again. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">If it suffers tactical defeats on the battlefield, if its leader Baghdadi or other top leaders are killed, or if it lost urban centres, the Islamic State could take any defeat and reframe it into a victory for its constituents, ironically giving it a skill that truly makes it like any other state in the world. </span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Ibrahim al-Marashi is an assistant professor at the Department of History, California State University, San Marcos.

deal with Boko Haram. If it had been true, years of ruthless killing of several thousand citizens would have been halted - suddenly - and the over-200 Chibok girls kidnapped seven months ago would have been freed.</p>\r\n<p>Sadly, Boko Haram held out for no longer than half-a-dozen hours before unleashing an attack on Abadam Village in Borno State, killing a resident. Very early the following day, <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/18/us-nigeria-violence-idUSKCN0I70H020141018\" target=\"_blank\">eight people were mowed down in Dzur Village</a>, also in Borno, consequently extinguishing whatever hopes anyone nursed of a ceasefire.</p>\r\n<p><span>So, within a day of the ceasefire announcement, delirious Nigerians had become crestfallen and had started asking: \"Was there really a ceasefire?\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span>It was not until another two weeks, though, that the leader of the group, Abubakar Shekau, dealt the <em>coup de grace</em> to a peace deal that had quickly gained international traction.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>\"We have not made ceasefire with anyone. What is our business with negotiation? We did not negotiate with anyone... It\'s a lie; it\'s a lie. We will not negotiate,\" <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2014/10/boko-haram-says-schoolgirls-married-20141031222536853563.html\" target=\"_blank\">he said in a video released on October 31</a>.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Who duped whom?</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span>I feel little pity for President Goodluck Jonathan over the ceasefire debacle. For a whopping 18 days after Boko Haram struck in Chibok, <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/obasanjo-jonathan-doubted-abduction-of-chibok-schoolgirls-for-18-days/179931/\" target=\"_blank\">Jonathan did not believe</a> that an abduction of more than 200 girls indeed took place. He thought it was all a ruse - a propaganda by opponents of his re-election ambition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>And he neither saw the need to visit Chibok nor invite the grieving parents to Abuja.<STRONG><i> <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.thecable.ng/jonathan-to-meet-only-5-chibok-schoolgirls\" target=\"_blank\">It took the pleading of a 17-year-old</a></i></STRONG>, Malala Yousafzai, for Jonathan to agree to meet with parents of the abducted girls \"within 24 hours\".</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span>So if Jonathan\'s peace-deal effort is now being misconstrued as a lie, well, it\'s a taste of his own medicine. But in fairness to him, ceasefire negotiations were ongoing. Just with the wrong Boko Haram representatives.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>In July and August, <STRONG><i><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.thecable.ng/exclusive-idriss-deby-brokered-ceasefire\" target=\"_blank\">\"Boko Haram commanders\" wrote letters to the president of Chad, Idriss Deby Itno</a></i></STRONG>, himself a former rebel leader and well-decorated military officer, asking him to broker a ceasefire with Lagos.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>It is a mystery what Alex Badeh, an air chief marshal and chief of defence staff, and Mike Omeri, coordinator of the National Information Centre (set up strictly to disseminate information relating to the insurgency) were thinking on October 17 when they gathered journalists together to tell them Boko Haram had announced a ceasefire.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>\"Already, the terrorists have announced a ceasefire in furtherance of their desire for peace,\" <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.thecable.ng/breaking-boko-haram-announces-ceasefire\" target=\"_blank\">Omeri said</a> gleefully. \"In this regard, the government of Nigeria has, in similar vein, declared a ceasefire.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Exactly 10 days later, Aminu Wali, minister of foreign affairs, assured journalists that the ceasefire was intact.</span></p>\r\n<p>\"Boko Haram are saying that those ones [attacks] were done by other rogues and criminals,\" he said after <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/27/us-nigeria-girls-idUSKBN0IG1S420141027\" target=\"_blank\">meeting with French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius</a><STRONG><i>.</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span>It was therefore shocking to hear Godswill Akpabio, governor of Akwa Ibom State and one of Jonathan\'s staunchest allies, blame the media for the post-ceasefire confusion. Tragic. Uncharitable. To be sure, Akpabio was speaking for the government and for Sambo Dasuki, the president\'s national security adviser (NSA).</span></p>\r\n<p>\"The NSA was of the opinion that <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.punchng.com/news/no-agreement-yet-on-chibok-girls-says-fg-2/\" target=\"_blank\">high level contact with the Republic of Chad</a> was made ... and of course, no agreement has been reached yet.

The media must be discharging its reportorial responsibilities with stiffer scrutiny.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Clearly, it is not enough for the government to declare that \"terrorists have announced a ceasefire\". Who announced it on behalf of the terrorists? Where was it announced? How, too? And what was proof that it was the decision of the Boko Haram hierarchy - not just a minority? Those were unanswered questions that should have been raised to temper the public optimism that followed the announcement.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>With Nigeria\'s main opposition party consistently haranguing and pillorying Jonathan for failing to halt Boko Haram, the president\'s men were desperate to polish his image ahead of the 2015 poll. The faintest hint of a ceasefire would work magic; it had to be announced to the media at once - even if prematurely. Looking back, the media was duped, and so were the people, in turn.</span></p>\r\n<p>Salkida warned early on that \"the government is more interested in <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.thecable.ng/salkida-ceasefire-news-shadows-bubbles\" target=\"_blank\">shadows and bubbles</a> than in substance\". Few paid attention, it seems.</p>\r\n<p><span>And so we are back to square one, having to deal with the disastrous strategy of the Nigerian military which has extended and broadened the conflict rather than curbed it.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><em>Fisayo Soyombo edits Nigerian online newspaper <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.thecable.ng/\" target=\"_blank\">TheCable</a>.</em></i></STRONG></p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/images/2014/11/4//2014114201759443734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/images/2014/11/4/2014114201759443734_20.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-12 01:15:15','Al Jazeera',9.06666700,7.48333300,NULL,NULL),(725,'20141111134013752810','http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/chaos-grows-both-sides-green-line-20141111134013752810.html','Chaos grows on both sides of the Green Line','Violence worsens after Israeli troops fatally shoot Palestinian man in the occupied West Bank.','<p><STRONG><i>Jerusalem — </i></STRONG>Weeks of tension and violence have continued to worsen, with a Palestinian man killed by Israeli troops in the occupied West Bank and numerous attacks and acts of vandalism reported inside Israel.</p>\r\n<p>Mohammed Jawabreh, 22, was killed on Tuesday during clashes in Al-Arroub refugee camp near Hebron.

The unrest started in Jerusalem over the summer, after a Palestinian teenager was murdered in an act of revenge for the killing of three Jewish Israelis in the West Bank.</p>\r\n<p>The city has seen nightly riots since then, fueled by a range of grievances, including visits by right-wing Knesset members to the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif and ongoing illegal settlement growth in the eastern half of the city.</p>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<p>Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem have carried out three attacks since Oct. 22, including two hit-and-runs that killed four people and the attempted assassination of a right-wing Jewish activist. Vandals slashed car tyres in the city on Monday night, spray-painting “no cars, no Arabs” on the sidewalks nearby.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas warned of a “religious war” if the provocations at Jerusalem’s holy sites continued.</p>\r\n<p>“With their actions, they are leading the region and the world to a devastating religious war,” he said at a ceremony in Ramallah marking the tenth anniversary of the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat’s death.</p>\r\n<p>Riots also spread to northern Israel on Friday night after a Palestinian was <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/will-not-be-silent-201411983325217385.html\" target=\"_blank\">shot dead by police</a>. A surveillance video showed the man, Khair Hamdan, banging on the windows of a police van while holding what appeared to be a knife; he then started retreating and turned away before an officer shot him.</p>\r\n<p>The shooting sparked five days of clashes in his hometown, Kafr Kanna, where dozens of people have been arrested, including 14 on Monday night.</p>\r\n<p>The mayor called the shooting “murder in cold blood”; the justice ministry has opened an investigation, but the officers involved returned to work earlier this week.</p>\r\n<p>“It was brutal behaviour. The officers didn’t abide by the regulations on when to shoot a suspect,” said Sawsan Zaher, a lawyer at Adalah, a Palestinian rights organisation.</p>\r\n<p>Residents of Kafr Kanna said the shooting reinforced a long-standing belief that police are quick to use force with Palestinians. After a series of riots in October 2000, in which 13 Palestinians were killed by police, a commission headed by a former high court justice accused officers of using “excessive force” against the protesters.</p>\r\n<p>“[Israel] must educate its police that the Arab public is not the enemy, and should not be treated as such,” the commission’s 2003 report concluded.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/palestinian-shot-dead-near-hebron-2014111110525262303.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 16px;\">RELATED: Palestinian man killed in West Bank unrest</span></a></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>A decade later, though, the sense of discrimination has not changed. Yitzhak Aharonovich, the public security minister, said last week that he hoped “all terrorist attacks” would end with the attacker’s death; police have killed all of the assailants in Jerusalem in recent weeks. Other senior politicians, including Economy Minister Naftali Bennett, have also defended the officers.</p>\r\n<p>“We’re still seen as the enemy,” said Faris Mahrous, who shut his garage during a general strike in Kafr Kanna earlier this week. “Aharonovitch, Bennett, they gave the police the legitimacy to kill Arabs, whether they’re involved in violence or not.”</p>\r\n<p>The spreading violence has become a major political liability for the government.

Her baby lived only a few hours.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">El Salvador is now facing increasing pressure from the United Nations, the Inter-American Court on Human Rights, and rights groups to amend its abortion law and release women jailed on abortion crimes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN\">\'Baby killer\'</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">Ilopango women\'s jail, tucked behind a busy suburban street, was originally built to house 220 inmates but now has nearly 2,000 prisoners, making it El Salvador\'s most overcrowded jail.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">Rivera, who has served three years of her prison sentence, will never forget her first night behind bars. She slept on the bare floor and when the lights went out at 10pm inmates chanted \"baby killer\" as she lay awake until dawn. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">\"Ending my life did cross my mind then,\" said Rivera, a single mother and former garment factory worker, whose son now lives with his grandmother.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">The only glimmer of hope for Rivera and the other 16 women is the campaign to set them free spearheaded by Dennis Munoz, an El Salvadoran human rights lawyer working for CDFA.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">In May, on behalf of CFDA and international rights groups, Munoz submitted a petition to local lawmakers seeking a pardon for the 17 imprisoned women and their release. All other legal avenues had been exhausted in their cases.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">Munoz said their convictions are based on flimsy medical evidence, flawed trials and inconsistent judicial rulings.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">\"I\'m known as the abortion lawyer, the one defending \'child murderers\' as the right-wing press here has branded these women,\" Munoz said outside the jail gates. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">\"What motivates me is to help poor people, who have the right to a good lawyer, and get innocent people out of jail. If this was my daughter, I wouldn\'t want her to suffer for a crime she didn\'t commit.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">El Salvador\'s Supreme Court is considering the petition with a decision expected within weeks. Eight of 15 judges would need to rule in favour of the women for them to be released, and President Salvador Sanchez Ceren would need to agree.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">If all other legal mechanisms in El Salvador fail, the cases of the 17 women could be taken before the Washington-based Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Munoz said. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">\"I\'ve told them I can\'t promise to get you out of jail or that I\'m going to win. But I will put up a fight, and a good fight,\" said Munoz, who has secured the early release of eight women jailed for abortion crimes since 2007.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i><span lang=\"EN\">Powerful Catholic Church</span></i></STRONG></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">Munoz is aware that a big part of his fight means coming up against a powerful conservative lobby in the country\'s congress, and an influential Roman Catholic Church and evangelical groups, who are all determined to maintain the outright abortion ban.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">They say the rights of an unborn child, which are enshrined in El Salvador\'s constitution, should be protected by law at all costs, from the moment of conception.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">Opposition conservative lawmakers, as well as the left-wing ruling FMLN party, fear easing the abortion ban would come at a political cost as it could alienate voters and the church.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">\"Some kind of election takes place every 18 months in El Salvador so it\'s difficult to make progress on the abortion issue because politicians worry decriminalising abortion will mean losing votes,\" Munoz said.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">With the issue of abortion an entrenched part of El Salvador\'s political battleground, few government officials are willing to publicly favour changing the abortion law.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">Mario Soriano, a medical doctor who heads the adolescent development programme at El Salvador\'s health ministry, is a rare voice calling for change, in favour of easing the country\'s abortion law. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">\"Here social and cultural norms are based on religious values, and not on a right-based approach,\" Soriano said.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">\"Religious values often outweigh clinical ethics, as well as the law being applied incorrectly, which means you can get doctors denouncing women of inducing abortions and then calling police to the hospital.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">For Rivera her only source of solace is reading the bible at the prison church. </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"I pray to God for this to end soon.

Two years ago, the idea of the All Blacks playing in Chicago would have been far-fetched. Just seeing the Haka at the beginning of the match made the event bucket list material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Interest divided</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>There was the sacking of Chicago Cubs manager Rick Renteria as well as Nik Wallenda’s high wire walk across the Chicago skyline that received more press locally. One Chicago publication referred to the All Blacks as “Australia’s legendary rugby team”.</p>\r\n<p>But despite all that, the message was loud and clear. And it was quite effective. There is no denying that rugby is growing in the US.</p>\r\n<p>“We have had more media at this event than ever before,” said USA Rugby President Nigel Melville.</p>\r\n<p>“Obviously it is a very exciting time for the game in the US but this will only make a difference if we continue our hard work and make sure that we capitalise on the momentum we have created.”</p>\r\n<p>For Melville, this was a great starting point for the next phase of growth for the sport and many see the untapped potential in this market.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>The impact</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>Towards the end of the press conference, a reply from Hansen hit home with many in attendance.</p>\r\n<p>“I think rugby has already turned the corner,” he said. “From what I’ve been told, there’s a large amount of youth players being developed and already playing rugby here in the US.”</p>\r\n<p>Ron Suarez is one of over 4,000 certified coaches across the US and he wants the authorities to focus on the grass-root in order to strengthen the game’s presence in the region.</p>\r\n<p>“During the last couple of years, we’ve finally dedicated time to developing the youth program and its coaches,” he said before adding that rugby did not have a clear pathway at the youth level but some inroads were being made.</p>\r\n<p>There have been approximately two million youngsters who have taken part in Rookie Rugby, a non-contact version of the sport, in the last few years. The increase in programs at high-school levels as well as scholarships are establishing an important foundation for the future.</p>\r\n<p>Add up those numbers and you have around five million youth involved in rugby.</p>\r\n<p>The numbers might not seem huge for a nation of over 300 million but the number has almost quadrupled since 2004.</p>\r\n<p>There is also the increased interest from tv where you can now see the World Cup, the Six Nations and the Aviva Premiership on cable, compared to pay-per-view or even illegal streams that rugby fans would have to find.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Growing numbers</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>In 2012, USA Rugby had reported over 128,000 active members. There are also 700 adult teams as well as 900 collegiate clubs taking part in over 20 national championships held annually.</p>\r\n<p>The most successful of all tournaments has been the Las Vegas Sevens. The event that launched in 2004 has gone from a niche tournament to one of the most popular in the Sevens World Series, reportedly raising $17m in tourism revenue for Sin City.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll decided to look at rugby in order to improve tackling techniques with professional American football players. His approach initiated talk on improving tackling, especially with the controversy about head injuries looming large from Pop Warner (youth levels) to the NFL.</p>\r\n<p>On the field itself, one of the highlights was when Kieran Read came up with a behind-the-back pass to set up Julian Savea for his second try of the day. When asked about that play, Read’s answer was simple: \"(The US) will probably get there, but it\'s tough because (rugby) is a sport you have to learn pretty early on.\"</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Planning the future</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>It was part of the learning experience that the players knew they had to go through in order to help the sport grow at all levels. That is why playing a team like the All Blacks in a non-World Cup setting and in the US is a major step in sparking that growth. However, more is needed.</p>\r\n<p>“A professional competition would be the next best thing for us,” said Melville.</p>\r\n<p>“The gap between our Eagles and clubs is too wide. We need a professional competition for our domestic players to train in a full-time environment.”</p>\r\n<p>This gap is most evident when you deal with a large base of the player pool still playing at the amateur level though now there are various Eagles that are playing professionally in Europe and Asia. The Eagles gave tremendous effort on the pitch that Saturday afternoon, especially considering they had only five training sessions prior to the match.</p>\r\n<p>Despite the result, there was still a great deal of buzz over what the Eagles could offer in the future.</p>\r\n<p>The sport is on the right path towards creating a tremendous rugby culture for future generations to reap the benefits and see a country like the US to the world’s best a tough fight.</p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/images/2014/11/11//20141111124352918734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/images/2014/11/11/20141111124352918734_20.jpg',NULL,NULL,'2014-11-12 00:22:39','Al Jazeera',0.00000000,0.00000000,NULL,NULL),(729,'2014111111137586106','http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/deserves-more-than-this-2014111111137586106.html','\'He deserves more than this\'','Palestinians mark 10th anniversary of Arafat\'s death amid high tensions in the West Bank and Jerusalem.','<p><STRONG><i> Nablus, West Bank - </i></STRONG> Atop Mount Gerizim, a crisp breeze provides some relief on an unusually hot November day.

This has set up a white Veteran’s Day on Tuesday, and it could be one to remember. <br /><br />The fierce winds dived out of the Canadian Prairies and brought blizzard conditions into the Midwest. Temperatures plunged and some parts saw more than 30cm of snow in barely 24 hours.<br /><br />The snow extends from the Rockies to the Lakes. The worst of the snow was across Minnesota and Wisconsin. St Augusta, about 120km northwest of Minneapolis, reported an impressive 42cm.<br /><br />It is still early to see this much snow. This is likely to be the heaviest pre-Thanksgiving snow for 20 years.<br /><br />The cold blast is all part of a powerful system pushed in by the remnants of Super Typhoon Nuri which passed Japan’s east coast over a week ago. Thereafter, the remnants of the storm explosively intensified as it moved over Alaska’s Aluetian Islands.<br /><br />The arrival of the storm smashing into the jet stream caused it to dive south and dragging Arctic air across Central Canada and into the US Plains.<br /><br />On Sunday Denver, Colorado had a top temperature of 21 Celsius. By Wednesday it’ll struggle to reach minus 11 degrees.<br /><br />The cold air will gradually make its way across much of the US. Atlanta, Georgia can expect a 10 degree drop in temperature by Thursday with highs barely touching 9C. <br /><br />The cold air will reach northern Florida early next week.

Among the dead was Shawki Ali Ahmed al Badani, wanted for his role in a plot that led to the closure of US embassies across the region in 2013. While the target was AQAP\'s leadership, it will have been welcomed by the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels who took Yemen\'s capital Sanaa in September and have since been in open warfare with AQAP.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">In Syria, US air strikes directed against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and al-Nusra Front benefit Iran\'s ally President Bashar al-Assad and their proxy force Hezbollah. Across the border in Iraq, Iranian-backed militias contribute towards President Barack Obama\'s plan to \"degrade and ultimately destroy the terrorist group known as ISIL\". While there is no military coordination between the two parties on the ground, it was only recently that <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21628602-will-conservative-camp-sink-nuclear-deal-goon-squad\" target=\"_blank\">Iran\'s Quds force was assisting Iraqi insurgents</a> kill US soldiers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Although there is nothing more to this than a mutual interest in the destruction of religious extremists, the fact is there are key strategic forces, including demographics and energy supplies, that are pulling the US and Iran closer together. While this may seem farfetched given the current state of affairs between the countries, Obama\'s supposed correspondence to Ayatollah Khamenei may presage the start of an irrevocable, if tortuous process, that ultimately delivers a calculated strategic swap of allegiances as Iran replaces Saudi Arabia as the United States\' favoured regional ally.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><STRONG><i>Shelf life</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">While the US relationship with Saudi Arabia is, of course, strong and of global significance - as the current downward pressures on oil prices show - it does have a shelf life. The current ruler, King Abdullah, is aged 90, and has already outlived two of his chosen successors. The current crown prince, Prince Salman, is 78. </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Furthermore, this relationship is primarily based on oil much of which sits in the Shia-dominated Eastern Province. Culturally or ideologically, there is little else that binds the US to the kingdom.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">The same can be said of Bahrain where a Sunni elite rules over a disenchanted Shia majority and significant hydrocarbon wealth. The precarious nature of this government was revealed in 2011, when during the Arab Spring, it requested GCC assistance to contain the uprising. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">The fact that Bahrain is also home to the US 5th Fleet is another reason for Americans to be flexible in their alignment with long-term regional power shifts.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">The final piece of this natural resources jigsaw is Iraq where the US invasion finally settled the result of the Iran-Iraq war with the installation of an Iranian influenced administration in Baghdad governing over the country\'s vast natural resources much of which lies in the Shia-dominated south.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">While there are large differences between the political aspirations of these various countries, when coupled with Iran\'s own formidable reserves of oil and gas - fourth and second largest in the world respectively - much of the region\'s natural resources can be seen to be physically located under Shia dominated areas.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Despite areas of clear economic mutual interest between the US and Iran real rapprochement remains some way off. For many Americans, Iran\'s funding of Hezbollah justifies its place within the Axis of Evil. For politicians to be in favour of closer dialogue can be contentious, as was demonstrated in the <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/11/obama-foreign-policy-after-midte-20141157357537430.html\" target=\"_blank\">recent midterm election campaigns</a>.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Useful scapegoat</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Similarly, in Iran the US is still often referred to as the Great Satan, particularly among its voluble clerics whose message is not one of reconciliation even if their influence is being blunted by increased secularism. The US also remains a useful scapegoat to blame for the country\'s woes many of which result from corruption and incompetence rather than from economic sanctions.</span></p>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Added to this antagonism is also the issue of Iran\'s nuclear ambitions and its relationship with Israel. Yet distant as it might seem, these interdependent issues are reconcilable even if the process is long and tortuous.

Or 2023, who knows.<br />At the meeting to discuss 2022 dates, all parties disagreed. They fought their corner. And yet their wishes are reported in some quarters as if revelatory or enlightening or even surprising.</p>\r\n<p>Is there really any chance the World Cup could be played in the summer? No. It was always a red herring, always stupid and misguided. As I said to FIFA General Secretary Jerome Valcke earlier this year, “why did Fifa not consider dates could be moved to accommodate a hot host country before the bidding process started? Or should hot countries be precluded from bidding, because that\'s a new one to me”.</p>\r\n<p>And yet we constantly check in on D\'Hooghe, the FIFA medical chief, as if he is ever going to say something new. His view is well documented: June-July is a no-no.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Proposing the dates</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>Does Fifa want the World Cup in November-December 2022? Yes? Is there a possible calendar that would work. Yes. Do some confederations prefer January-February? Yes. But that’s not going to happen unless they shift it to 2023 (Uefa are reportedly open-minded on 2023 and it does have positives).</p>\r\n<p>But IOC won’t budge over 2022. Why would they and why should they?</p>\r\n<p>It\'s all a game. Will FIFA really take the IOC on and fall out when they don\'t need to? The day FIFA starts disrespecting sponsors and broadcasting contracts (even the IOC\'s) is the day they cease to respect the money that comes in to both organisations. Why would they take on such a potentially damaging battle? They have enough problems to contents with.</p>\r\n<p>Do the European Clubs Association want April-May? Yes, but that\'s surely the mother of all non-starters. European Cup finals in June? What nonsense. It rips the heart out of the very European season finale the clubs should want to protect.</p>\r\n<p>And it\'s Ramadan in the month of April 2022. As if a World Cup would be played in Qatar during that period. Is it ignorance or sheer bullishness by the ECA to suggest it might be. To me this is close to being the most staggering of all the hot air being produced around the exhausting topic of 2022.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Winter it should be</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>The only \'development\' is the Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee saying winter is the Middle East\'s preference. After years of saying they will bend to whatever Fifa wants they surely have the right to express a preference. Though they then clarified they are ready any time of year. And recognising that the \'international community\' are leaning towards winter is hardly a u-turn I saw it headlined as that in a reputable football magazine.</p>\r\n<p>Of course if should be played in winter. As I\'ve said in this column before, the world doesn\'t revolve around Europe.<br />And remember this official meeting only came after 11th-hour calls from Executive Committee Members to actually spend time consulting.</p>\r\n<p>When I headed to cover the ExCo meeting last October, I had been quietly informed deals were pretty much done, and that there would be a switch to winter. It\'s as if the process is going backwards.</p>\r\n<p>And now, more than seven years before the tournament, whatever they eventually settle on, there\'s a sudden scramble to come up with a date.</p>\r\n<p>Never mind the Garcia report, and Eckert, and sponsors leaving Fifa. Never mind the latest alarming Chuck Blazer revelations involving the FBI. Never mind the public\'s irritation over the whole kerfuffle. Let\'s all make our demands on which date suits us best.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Fifa\'s decision</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>I am grateful to Keir Radnedge - KeirRadnedge.com - for reminding me what former Fifa official Mr Blazer himself said about why they decided to simultaneously award two World Cups, 2018 and 2022. Arguably the most damaging mistake in sports administration history.</p>\r\n<p>“It was a good idea at the time [in late 2007]. We were facing a variety of things – economic uncertainty and the further uncertainty of how successful we might be with the World Cup in South Africa. Given the concerns we had, being able to market two World Cups right away on the strength of where we were plus, frankly, our thoughts were probably that there would be two big markets.</p>\r\n<p>“No-one considered then that Qatar would be a winner or even, for that matter, that they would be bidding.”</p>\r\n<p>They did bid. And they won. And guess what got \'Lost in Translation\'. It\'s extremely hot in summer and the tournament would realistically need to be switched to winter however flexible the Supreme Committee were being.</p>\r\n<p>Fifa’s failure to not recognise the heat issue, to deal with it, to manage the dates disruption decisively. It\'s what has brought us to this messy point.</p>\r\n<p>Groundhog Day all over again.</p>\r\n<p>Fifa may wish they could call Murray\'s Ghostbusters. Those ghosts of the infamous 2010 bid process, and the instigation of the process three years earlier, are still haunting them, and the football world.</p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/9/10//20149109363152734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/9/10//20149109363152734_2.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-11

It\'s the oil, stupid ','To predict whether Iraq will remain a country - or break apart - we need to look at the oil as well as ISIL.','<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">This week, Iraq\'s Prime Minister Haider al-Abbadi is scheduled to visit Erbil, his first visit to the capital of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq as premier. The lead-up to the visit has been long and torturous, including months of speculation and tactical manoeuvring over the potential form of a revenue-sharing deal between Baghdad and the Kurds. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Though less dramatic than the day-to-day fighting against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the outcome of these negotiations could do more to cement the unity of Iraq - or hasten its break-up - than events taking place on the battlefield. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">For almost a year now, the Kurds have lived without their customary budget transfers from Baghdad. In previous years, the <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/06/16/us-kurdistan-oil-idINKBN0ER26720140616\" target=\"_blank\">Kurds received 17 percent of net revenues</a> from Baghdad - around a billion dollars a month - to cover $750m of Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) salaries and pay for ministry programmes. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">This year, Iraqi Kurdistan has to reckon on hundreds of millions of dollars of additional costs each month to maintain full mobilisation of the Peshmerga to fight ISIL and to support nearly 1.4 million displaced Arabs, Kurds and minorities. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">In 2014, Baghdad has only paid about a month and a half of salaries, forcing the KRG to default on salaries despite taking out multibillion dollar loans. The region is now in debt to the tune of about $8bn. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Though the Kurds are <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/05/turkey-kurdish-oil-gamble-risky-baghdad.html\" target=\"_blank\">earning close to $450m of revenue </a>from their independent oil sales via Turkey, the government in Ankara is only releasing 17 percent of KRG oil revenues to the Kurds while negotiations with Baghdad are under way. This covers less than 10 percent of KRG costs. </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Two paths for the Kurds</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The situation can resolve in one of two ways. </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Abbadi and the Kurds could agree on a revenue-sharing deal that would be written into the 2015 budget and implemented for a year. The deal would involve a joint oil marketing arrangement between the Iraqi state and the Kurds, and a commitment of set volumes of KRG-produced oil exports in 2015. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The Kurds would receive their oil revenues directly from international banks in a transparent process, and these revenues would be considered a partial advance on the KRG\'s restored monthly payments from Baghdad.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Such a deal could also allow Iraq to export 200,000-400,000 barrels per day of Kirkuk crude through the Kurds internal pipeline network. Due to ISIL\'s destruction of much of the federal Iraqi government\'s northern export infrastructure, the Kurds offer the only way for Iraq to monetise this oil in the coming years. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Alternately, if Baghdad and the Kurds cannot agree on a deal, the KRG may continue down the path of independent oil exports via Turkey, without Baghdad\'s cooperation. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">This path is choked with legal and political challenges and would eventually tear apart Iraq and the Kurdistan Region. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Baghdad would lose its northern export route for Kirkuk crude and collapsed talks might drive Turkey to release the full weight of KRG oil revenues to Erbil, speeding up Kurdish economic independence. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">For the Kurds, the independent export path represents a slow painful path to economic self-sufficiency that could entail a year or more of deep recession, and would then only swap dependence on Baghdad for dependence on Ankara. </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Abbadi\'s choice: Unite or split Iraq</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">At this crucial time in Iraq\'s history, only one factor is holding the country together: the wealth created by southern Iraq\'s oil exports and how these funds will be distributed in the forthcoming 2015 budget. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Federal government oil revenues are central to every major initiative to strengthen the country. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The southern Shia provinces demand economic development through the payment of \"petrodollars\" to oil-producing provinces. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The Sunni provinces want the federal government to fund the National Guard programme, to raise new US-trained military units to allow the Sunni areas to defeat ISIL and thereafter self-police. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> The Kurds view staying in Iraq as an economic necessity, for now, and their benefactor, Turkey, will push them to stay at the negotiating table with Baghdad as long as a deal is possible. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">All the factions will have to accept that Iraqi funds will be limited in 2015 due to declining oil prices and skyrocketing war costs. But all factions - including the Kurds - also need to be convinced that it is better to stay in Iraq than to go their own way. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">When the Iraqi government was formed, Baghdad promised to restore monthly payments to the Kurds and this should be done in mid-November, as a symbol of goodwill as negotiations start. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">After a year of non-payment to the Kurds and months of non-payment to the ISIL-held provinces, the federal government has the surplus money to restart payments. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The basic truth is that \"Sunni uprisings\" and \"Kurdish separatism\" are not the key threats to Iraq\'s unity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Iraq\'s Shia are the only power with the ability to break up Iraq, and they can do it in a heartbeat if they decide to cut the Sunnis and the Kurds off from Basra\'s oil wealth in 2015. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">For this reason, Abbadi holds the fate of a unified Iraq in his hands when he travels to Erbil. By paying Kurdish salaries in November and striking a fair revenue-sharing deal for 2015, he can score a major victory for Iraq\'s future on a vital, if unsung, battlefield.</span><em><STRONG><i></i></STRONG></em></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Michael Knights is the Lafer Fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

The Youth Courage Awards were first announced on Malala Yousufzai\'s birthday last year, as part of \"Malala Day\" to honour the rights activist and recent Nobel Laureate.</p>\r\n<p>\"I am humbled that my voice and journey have been appreciated,\" Katti told Al Jazeera backstage. \"But this award is for my mom first and then my friends at Kranti. I hope they will recognise their own potential and make their own stories.\"</p>\r\n<p>Katti\'s story received global attention last year, when she became the first girl from the red-light district of Kamathipura in India\'s financial capital Mumbai to procure a full scholarship at Bard College in the US state of New York.</p>\r\n<p>She was also named one of 25 women under 25 to watch by <em>Newsweek</em> magazine for her heroic efforts to break the social stigma associated with Dalits, a sub-caste considered \"untouchable\" in India, and to not only pursue an education abroad, but also become a representative of a repressed community.</p>\r\n<p>India\'s Dalits have been historically marginalised and are often targets of violence and discrimination by some members of the privileged castes. In the western state of Maharashtra - with Mumbai as its capital - there have been several instances of atrocities against the community.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Away from home</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>Katti said that her trajectory as the daughter of a factory worker, growing up in a loft of a brothel where she regularly snuck into the rooms to watch her favourite Bollywood movies on TV, to the sprawling campus of Bard in the hamlet of Annandale-on-Hudson, has comprised a gamut of learning experiences.</p>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Her mother was not a sex worker, but her grandmother did domestic chores in the brothel after her grandfather, a victim of drug abuse, passed away and left them to fend for themselves.</p>\r\n<p>\"When I sat on the plane and saw the map of the distance to the US, I was scared. I\'m excited about travelling, but when I saw how far I would be from home, I was overwhelmed,\" she said.</p>\r\n<p>Katti explained that growing up in the brothel, which is all her mother could afford at the time, she always had some sort of family and the sex workers were very protective of her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"They braided my hair when my mom went off to work and I celebrated Diwali, Holi and other festivals with them. They raised me and were the only family I knew,\" Katti said.</p>\r\n<p>Similarly when she moved into a shelter home sponsored by Kranti, the Indian NGO that helped bring Katti to the US, she found a family with other girls of like background and life experiences.</p>\r\n<p>\"Bard is a great school, but it\'s lonely in America. I am very connected to my mother and Kranti family back home, so once I finish my education, I know I will go back,\" she said.</p>\r\n<p>Katti grew up wanting to be a chartered accountant but after being exposed to social sciences, she decided to study psychology so that she could help other girls when she returns home.</p>\r\n<p>Part of this change also came about when Katti had time away from home to reflect on some of the events from her past, namely when she was a victim of sexual abuse at the age of 11 or 12. \"As I understand, 50 percent of those who abuse, have been abused themselves and need help,\" she said.</p>\r\n<p>While she acknowledged that this doesn\'t make the act forgivable, she understands the root cause and wants to help others who have suffered through it.</p>\r\n<p>\"It\'s not all about the money,\" Katti said. \"There are better ways to give back and what is better than working on issues like gender and sexuality, child abuse and basic human rights.\"</p>\r\n<p>For this reason, she continues to work with Kranti and she hopes to work with girls from the Dalit community, so that they don\'t remain oppressed and denied opportunities by the caste hierarchy.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>College culture</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>Even though Katti has been in the public limelight - addressing a massive crowd at a TEDx event in India in March, where she spoke on issues of empowerment - she still considers herself to be reserved.</p>\r\n<p>She has, however, joined Bard\'s Bollywood dance club and the South Asian student association.</p>\r\n<p>\"I grew up with people calling me names like \'cow dung\' and \'black bamboo\' because of my dark skin and I could never take friends back home because of where I lived,\" she said. \"So I am naturally socially awkward and have low self-esteem.\"</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Ironically, it is this same quiet maturity that has drawn people to her.</p>\r\n<p>\"More than a great story, I see her as an amazing human being who is grounded and family oriented,\" said Sabrina Sultana, one of Katti\'s two close friends at Bard.</p>\r\n<p>Originally from Bangladesh, Sultana met Katti<STRONG><i> </i></STRONG>through the Bollywood dance group and they bonded over their shared South Asian culture.</p>\r\n<p>\"We have another friend from Tibet and usually the three of us have slumber parties, eat pizza and watch Bollywood movies. But Shweta really misses Indian food,\" she added.</p>\r\n<p>For Katti, adjusting to the US system of education has been a challenge, after being schooled in a Marathi medium school all her life, especially when it comes to learning English.

Some of them walk up to 15km a day for a single meal, feasting on anything from vegetable broth to stale bread made from animal feed.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\">Limited supplies of food have reached the markets since the siege of Eastern Ghouta began in October 2012, and this does not include fresh milk and meat. The increasingly scarce supply of staples such as bread and rice has created a black market for the coveted goods, with some shops raising their prices by 600 percent.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\">Eastern Ghouta was the site of a chemical attack in August 2013, during which <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/08/201382163812810810.html\" target=\"_blank\">Syrian activists say</a> government forces killed hundreds of people. It is also one of the last remaining swaths of territory held by the Free Syrian Army in the Damascus area.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\">Several residents say they are suffering from the regime\'s collective punishment. Sending their children out with buckets to collect food has become a last resort for overburdened parents in Eastern Ghouta.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\">Schools are shut down as most were turned into shelters for families who lost their houses in the unrelenting war. \"There\'s no food, water, heat or electricity. We lack all of life\'s basic necessities,\" said Refat, a fatigued young mother of two bucket children taking a rest from mopping the flooded floors of her shoddily constructed cinder block home.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\">\"I don\'t send my children out in the streets to ask for food, but at the same time I don\'t stop them either,\" she told Al Jazeera with a sigh. \"Sometimes they wake up in the middle of the night demanding food, but there is none in the house.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Body\">Oddly enough, smiles and a sense of cheery camaraderie can be seen emanating from Eastern Ghouta\'s bucket children as they leap over the town\'s rubble searching for food.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\">Tony Hoffman, an expert who specialises in the psychological effects of war on children, says the novelty of activities such as searching for food in groups allows children to perceive these means of survival as fun activities.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\">\"These are children who are largely living in a situation of boredom and confinement,\" Hoffman told Al Jazeera. \"[They] want happiness and can experience it in the most meagre and dire of situations as long as there\'s something that gives them stimulus.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\">Still, this does not change the fact that these children are operating in what UNICEF says is \"one of the most dangerous places on earth to be a child\". Walking in public places carries the risk of being caught in sniper crossfire, along with the potential for physical or sexual assault.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\">\"We\'ve seen alarming rates of neglect and labour exploitation, as well as physical and sexual abuse among these children,\" Manal Eid, programme manager at War Child Holland, a charity organisation based in Lebanon, told Al Jazeera, referring to children in areas such as Eastern Ghouta.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\">The organisation\'s country director, Andre Gonzalez, added: \"There is a lot of fear that comes from high incidences of abuse among these children even after they arrive here in Lebanon.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\">Reaching out to support the bucket children of Eastern Ghouta and others at risk, has been particularly challenging for the international community. The Syrian government must grant groups access to operate in Syria, and only about 15 or 16 international NGOs currently have authorisation to do so. \"We hope they will be open to more international NGOs because we\'re ready to help the children affected most by the war,\" Gonzalez added.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\">Even those who have been granted access still face numerous obstacles in reaching children with the most critical needs. Earlier this month, UNICEF announced that its aid trucks successfully reached the town of Afrin in northern Syria - the first time in 12 months that humanitarian aid has reached the Kurdish enclave previously under siege by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and other Islamist affiliates. The breakthrough followed a UN announcement of cuts to the food aid received by over 4.2 million Syrians due to a budget shortfall.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\">Aid can only enter Eastern Ghouta at the government\'s discretion, while it finds its way to seep through the cracks of less centralised rebel-held areas such as Afrin. Efforts by Kurdish forces, the People\'s Protection Units (YPG), and Free Syrian Army rebels has allowed aid to flow in brief spurts to northern towns like Afrin, while Eastern Ghouta remains stonewalled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Body\">The World Food Programme had been pushing for access to communities under siege \"to provide life-saving assistance and also to assess the scale of the needs\" - but so far, these calls have gone unanswered.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\">The longer these bucket children wait for aid, the graver the effect will be on their mental and physical wellbeing. Makeshift clinics staffed by a few volunteer doctors and community members in Eastern Ghouta have reported a recent increase in cases of malnutrition and kidney failure.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\">\"At the beginning of the fighting, we\'d see just a couple of instances of treatable malnutrition every so often,\" said one doctor, speaking to Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity for fear of regime persecution. \"Now, there are children brought to us with severe malnourishment symptoms regularly.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\">Even after malnutrition is treated, affected children often continue to suffer from long-lasting impacts on their cognitive development. Hoffman says that the bucket children will, for a long time, have difficulties focusing on activities such as reading or writing because they have become trained to be on guard, looking for food.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\">\"The longer the period of malnutrition, the worse is the life outcome,\" he said. </p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\">Meanwhile, the sounds of war pierce the silence of Refat\'s house, as her two children sweep the roads outside for anything edible.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\">\"They don\'t understand the situation around them much at all,\" she said. \"They only understand their hunger, which I\'m afraid they\'re starting to think is a normal feeling.\"</p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/9/201411912130849734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/Images/2014/11/9/201411912130849734_20.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-10 22:40:16','Al Jazeera',33.51300000,36.29200000,NULL,NULL),(775,'2014119115159637457','http://www.aljazeera.com/sport/features/2014/11/female-boxers-fight-survival-us-2014119115159637457.html','Female boxers\' fight for survival in the US','Better competition and bigger prize-money is forcing female boxers to head over to Mexico.','<p>A male American boxing champion will seldom put his belt on the line in his opponent’s backyard - Floyd Mayweather Jr, the world’s highest paid athlete, has not fought a single professional bout abroad.</p>\r\n<p>But women’s boxing in the US is a different story. It tells a tale of female pugilists often looking outside their home base for better opportunities.</p>\r\n<p>New York resident Alicia “Slick” Ashley lost her WBC Super Bantamweight belt in a very close match in Mexico City last September. Her challenger, Tijuana native Jackie “Aztec Princess” Nava, was Mexico’s best.</p>\r\n<p>Ashley, 47, is one of several female boxing champions taking their chances south of the border, a telling indication that Mexico is embracing the sport in a way that its northern neighbour hasn’t in years. Experts go as far as wondering whether US women’s boxing will see better days or die a slow death.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Dual benefits</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>Hailing from Jamaica, Ashley knew fighting the country’s darling in front of 8,500 raucous fans would be challenging. But the prize was worth it. In May, she earned $3,000 for an easy non-title match in New York. For her September 6 face-off against Nava, she pocketed ten times that amount as well as the chance to compete against a world-class opponent.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Ashley and Nava co-headlined a card with Mexico’s top male boxers. Both bouts aired on one of Mexico’s premier television networks and took place in a 22,000-seat arena. That night, the other large TV station in the country broadcast another boxing card headlined by women.</p>\r\n<p>In the US, women’s bouts are seldom televised or held in venues of comparable size. The Madison Square Garden, for example, last featured a women’s bout in 2009.</p>\r\n<p>“Women’s boxing in the US is dying,” former boxer Laura Serrano, who helped legalise the sport in Mexico City in 1998 and now lives in Las Vegas, told Al Jazeera.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Lack of opportunity</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>In the past, women’s boxing in the US found “incredible support”, so much so that Serrano herself headed north in search of better opportunities.</p>\r\n<p>Lack of skills is not the issue. Ashley says US promoters tend to set up lopsided matches to preserve their fighters’ record, a common practice in the sport.</p>\r\n<p>“In Mexico it’s like a ‘you wanna fight? I’m ready to fight’ kind of attitude,” she added.</p>\r\n<p>There are also increasingly less opportunities to fight for a belt in the US.</p>\r\n<p>A November 8 bout between heavyweights Martha Salazar and Tanzee Daniel in California was the first WBC world female title fight in two years. In the same period, Mexico has hosted 14, while Argentina has held six.</p>\r\n<p>With the win, Salazar is the only US female world champion in the sport’s four main sanctioning bodies.</p>\r\n<p>Perhaps a sign of things to come, California native Ava Knight, who has fought eight out of 10 title fights in Mexico, will also go for a vacant WBC title on November 13 in Washington DC. Both matches may give the US a much-needed chance to regain some ground in the international women’s boxing scene. </p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Lack of tv exposure</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>In the mid-to-late 90s, female professional boxing was booming. In 1996, overnight sensation Christy Martin fought on a Mike Tyson pay-per-view undercard. A few years later, Muhammad Ali’s daughter Laila was earning $15,000 for her early contests.</p>\r\n<p>But all of that success revolved around a few “’it girls”, according to Malissa Smith, author of “A History of Women’s Boxing”, and those opportunities eventually died out.</p>\r\n<p>In 2012, experts wondered whether female boxing’s historic debut in the London Games would breathe life back into the sport. It didn’t.</p>\r\n<p>By the time women’s amateur boxing gained international recognition, professional female boxers were no longer on TV, said Smith.</p>\r\n<p>Female boxers often blame the “old school” mentality that has ruled the big promotion companies for decades. They hope that as new blood enters the business, women will once again be brought to the forefront.</p>\r\n<p>As women’s boxing takes a plunge, its main competitor, Mixed Martial Arts, <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/sport/othersports/2014/04/rise-mixed-martial-arts-201441094427103582.html\" target=\"_blank\">is stealing the show</a> in the US and abroad.

In women’s boxing, deaths are rare, but not impossible. The sport claimed its latest victim on October 25.</p>\r\n<p>Most cab drivers in Mexico are able to name their favourite female boxer in a heartbeat while girls as young as five fill the local gyms after school. After all, boxing is the country’s second most popular sport.</p>\r\n<p>Boxing is still a male-dominated sport. At the highest levels, earnings of over $100,000 per bout have been reported. However, most female fighters struggle like their US counterparts.</p>\r\n<p>And the elephant in the room remains: Even the highest purse ever received by a woman pales in comparison with the multi-million dollar payouts to the men.</p>\r\n<p>Despite the odds, Mexico remains a hotbed for women’s boxing. And as long as the sport continues to nosedive in the US, its southern neighbour will remain the best (and nearest) bet for top-level boxers like Ashley.</p>\r\n<p><em>Video credits: Sandra Larriva Henaine & Dave Mayers</em></p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/9//201411912241790734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/9//201411912241790734_2.jpg',NULL,NULL,'2014-11-10 22:34:41','Al Jazeera',0.00000000,0.00000000,NULL,NULL),(776,'2014111085638828135','http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/iraqi-troops-push-back-isil-oil-rich-city-2014111085638828135.html','Iraqi troops push back ISIL in oil-rich city','Fierce fighting continues between government forces and armed group in the northern city of Beiji.','<p>The Iraqi army has reached the centre of the northern city of Beiji, as they continue their effort to break the siege of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) on the country\'s biggest oil refinery nearby.</p>\r\n<p>Exclusive images obtained by Al Jazeera on Monday showed government forces pushing ahead into the rebel-controlled city, with ISIL\'s flag covered with an Iraqi security forces slogan.</p>\r\n<p>Al Jazeera\'s Imran Khan, reporting from Baghdad, said clashes continue and the armed rebels are fighting back.</p>\r\n<p>He said the oil refinery, located about 50km from the city centre, is the next big target.

He kicks over one of the vats - cut from a used oil drum - and the steaming content pours onto the concrete. Female workers pick over the catch, collecting mussels into a grubby sieve.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The livelihoods of squatter fishermen such as Benjol - who like many Indonesians uses just one name - have faced multiple threats over the past three decades.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Land reclamations in the 1980s and \'90s - primarily for high-end housing developments - have pushed them from their original settlements, and Jakarta Bay\'s toxic water containing dangerous levels of lead and mercury has prompted the city administration to ban mussel cultivation on public health grounds.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">To make matters worse, the land on which they live is sinking into the sea.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"We don\'t want to move from here,\" Benjol says, but his community may have no choice. Straddling north Jakarta\'s flood defences, they are vulnerable to the high tides that last year breached the dyke, exacerbating the annual wet season floods.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">North Jakarta suffers subsidence rates of up to 17cm a year in some areas - caused by the excessive extraction of ground water from the soft soil on which the city is built - meaning whole neighbourhoods will be several metres underwater by 2030. The homes of 4.5 million people are threatened with permanent inundation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\'Giant seawall\'</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">To avert this disaster, Indonesia\'s outgoing government last month rushed to commence the construction of its futuristic $40bn \"giant seawall\" development, otherwise known as the National Capital Integrated Coastal Development (NCICD). </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Comprised of a 25km dyke that will close the bay of Jakarta and 17 man-made islands shaped into a \"giant garuda\" - a mythical bird used as Indonesia\'s national symbol - the development is set to become one of the world\'s largest infrastructure projects.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span>Its first phase of strengthening the city\'s existing defences began last month, and the sealing off of Jakarta bay is expected to be completed by 2022.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">To bankroll the scheme, predominantly mid and high-end housing developments will be sold off; eventually housing up to 1.5 million people on the giant garuda. The ambitions for the development cannot be understated - with the NCICD master plan pushing for Indonesia\'s \"seat of government\" to be relocated from central Jakarta to the new city.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">However, the plans have drawn significant criticism, with detractors claiming the seawall is a bogus solution that will once more displace traditional fishermen and other low-income groups from their communities.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The People\'s Coalition for Fisheries Justice Indonesia (KIARA) says thousands of people such as Benjol will be removed from their homes to make way for what they see as just another luxury housing development.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The government has defended the initiative, saying 17 percent of the new development will be devoted to social housing, and will give fishermen closer access to the cleaner waters 6km out to sea - where the seawall is to be constructed.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The likelihood of the city\'s poorest being housed on the giant garuda seems limited, but it\'s a social injustice most Jakartans are likely to forgive if they can be assured that the seawall will prevent the capital from sliding into the sea.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">That, however, cannot be guaranteed.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The project seeks to prevent Jakarta\'s inundation by two means: firstly by blocking out the ocean, and secondly by boosting water supply so that ground water extraction may be reduced - thus reducing average subsidence rates of 7.5cm a year.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i><span>Fetid rivers</span></i></STRONG></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">To achieve this second goal the bay, once sealed, will be converted into a giant \"freshwater\" reservoir fed by 13 rivers that flow through the city and out into the bay. However, the success of creating this alternative source of potable water - and perhaps the success of the entire project - may rely on the Indonesian government\'s ability to clean up West Java\'s fetid rivers.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Jakarta\'s brown-and-black, plastic-strewn waterways are fed primarily by the Citarum River, cited in 2013 as one of the world\'s top 10 most-polluted sites next to the Niger Delta and Chernobyl.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Addressing a seminar recently, acting Governor of Jakarta Basuki \"Ahok\" Tjahaja Purnama said he \"had his doubts\" about the project, as reported by the <em>Jakarta Post</em>, comparing it to a similar seawall project in South Korea where he said engineers had struggled to prevent the formation of a \"lake of mud\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">For the model to work in Jakarta, water pollution levels must be reduced by between 75-95 percent.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">If the NCICD fails to convert the bay of Jakarta into a beautiful freshwater reservoir then alternative sources of piped water must be found or ground water extraction will continue and Jakarta will continue to sink. The NCICD master plan concedes that the planned outer wall can only protect Jakarta until 2080, unless the subsidence stops.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Purba Sianipar, assistant deputy minister of economic affairs, seemed unaware the project had such an expiry date when interviewed by Al Jazeera.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"I don\'t know in what document you read that,\" <span>Sianipar</span> said. \"We never designed anything [based] on that short period of time. We would like this seawall dyke to exist for not only 100 but 1,000 years to protect the city.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\'Limited warranty\'</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The minister was later disappointed when he conferred with Victor Coenen, project manager for Witteveen Bos, a Dutch engineering firm that has helped Jakarta create the project\'s master plan.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"He called me back [to check] actually,\" Coenen told Al Jazeera. \"But no, infrastructure projects are the same as all products, they have a limited warranty.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"I hope for Jakarta that the land subsidence will stop because [if it does not] by then [2080] you will be talking about another five metres to seven metres of water in front of Jakarta city, and those are levels that you really have to wonder if you can still protect yourself against.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Inundation by the sea is also only one front on which Jakarta is fighting a battle to stay above water. Every year, Jakarta\'s rivers break their banks as floodwaters surge through from West Java. There are concerns that capping the exits to these rivers may exacerbate seasonal flooding.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The problems of sea inundation, flooding, water pollution, and water supply are intricately interlinked, and the success of the giant sea wall is bound to factors far beyond the control of its project managers.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"It\'s about who will own the project.

Around the world there are approximately 40 to 50 lightning discharges per second, or nearly 1.5 million each year.<br /><br />Until recently it was thought that the (some would say unenviable) record for the most lightning activity, was Kifuka in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).<br /><br />Kifuka is a small village in the central-eastern mountains of the DRC, five degrees north of the equator, lying at an elevation of 970m. The combination of warm, moist air forced to rise above the mountains, is enough to see an average of 158 lightning discharges per square km each year.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Kifuka there is a new kid on the block, claiming a far higher frequency of lightning discharges.<br /><br />The village of Catatumbo in northern Venezuela, lies on the shore of Lake Maracaibo. It is said to experience as many as 250 discharges per square km each year.  That translates into 28 visible flashes in the area every minute.<br /><br />Several factors combine to make Catatumbo so prone to lightning. Lake Maracaibo is a natural amphitheatre, surrounded by mountains. It tends to trap the warm, moist trade winds blowing in off the Caribbean Sea.<br /><br />This warm, moisture-laden air is overlain by cool, dry air which spills in off the Andes to the west. A big decrease in temperature through the atmosphere is one of the main requisites of the cumulonimbus clouds which eventually produce lightning.<br /><br />The warm air is naturally buoyant. It rises through the atmosphere, cooling and condensing into clouds as it does so. As the rising air reaches higher elevations the water droplets turn to ice and it is friction between ice and water droplets which helps to set up the electrical charges in the cloud.<br /> <br />When the difference between positive and negative charges within the cloud becomes too great, a discharge takes place from the cloud to the ground, within the cloud, or from the cloud into the surrounding atmosphere.<br />  <br />Catatumbo’s crowning is the result of campaigning by local environmentalist Eric Quiroga who has spent more than 20 years studying the phenomenon.<br /><br /></p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/10/2014111083431617734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/Images/2014/11/10/2014111083431617734_20.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-10 20:06:32','Richard Angwin',0.00000000,0.00000000,NULL,NULL),(783,'2014119162522899550','http://www.aljazeera.com/sport/tennis/2014/11/nishikori-humbles-murray-finals-opener-2014119162522899550.html','Federer, Nishikori win London openers','Federer beats Raonic, Nishikori eases past former Wimbledon champion Murray in the Tour Finals opening round.','<p>Roger Federer eased his way into the ATP World Tour Finals with a 6-1, 7-6  defeat of Canadian newcomer Milos Raonic in his opening round-robin match.</p>\r\n<p>The 33-year-old Swiss, competing for a record 13th time at the season-ender, took advantage of some early Raonic nerves to pocket the opening set in 25 minutes but things got tougher.</p>\r\n<p>Raonic, the first Canadian to qualify for the tournament, began to do damage with his booming serve and even carved out several break point opportunities as world number two Federer\'s level dipped slightly.</p>\r\n<p>Six-time champion Federer saved a set point at 5-6 and that proved to be Raonic\'s last chance.</p>\r\n<p>Federer quickly asserted himself in the tiebreak and reeled off seven successive points to move top of Group B alongside Japan\'s Kei Nishikori who had earlier beaten Andy Murray.</p>\r\n<p>Nishikori started his maiden campaign at the ATP Finals with a 6-4, 6-4 win over home favourite Murray.</p>\r\n<p>The fourth-seeded Japanese - the first Asian player to qualify for the year-end championship - was in complete control and secured important points in a tough Group B that also includes Roger Federer and Milos Raonic.</p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/images/2014/11/10//2014111084220198621_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/images/2014/11/10/2014111084220198621_20.jpg',NULL,'Reuters','2014-11-10 19:45:18','Al Jazeera',48.85661400,2.35222190,NULL,NULL),(784,'2014111062828131931','http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/11/message-obama-secret-letter-ay-2014111062828131931.html','The message in Obama\'s \'secret\' letter to the Ayatollah','Like Obama, Khamenei has to contend with his own set of hardliners who vehemently oppose Iran\'s nuclear talks. ','<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Why should the president of the only superpower in the world feel it necessary to write a \"secret\" letter to his counterpart in another country? Indeed Barack Obama\'s reported </span><a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://online.wsj.com/articles/obama-wrote-secret-letter-to-irans-khamenei-about-fighting-islamic-state-1415295291\" target=\"_blank\"> letter to Iran\'s supreme leader</a>, Ali Khamenei, is intriguing and shows the level of pressure he must be under to have to act under cover. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Yet, if true, it is the right move by the US president on the eve of the ongoing trilateral talks in Oman between Iran, US and the EU and only a few weeks prior to the final round of nuclear talks in Vienna on November 24. It would underpin the importance of the success of the deal and the positive combination of factors at play. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">We know little about the content of the letter but in it Obama has, no doubt, reiterated his gesture at the UN General Assembly in September: \"Do not let this opportunity pass,\" he said addressing Iran. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">The pressure from the Israeli lobby, both in and out of the US Congress, is alive and well. The recent US mid-term election has made it even more vocal. Senator John McCain accused Obama of playing \"footsie\" with Iran and Congressman John Boehner expressed serious doubts about Iran\'s intentions. Obama must have reminded Khamenei of these factors, stressing that the November 24 deadline is only a few weeks before the Republican-dominated Congress takes hold on January 6. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><STRONG><i>Obama\'s hardliners</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Like Obama, Khamenei also has to contend with his own set of hardliners who vehemently oppose Iran\'s nuclear talks. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\"The only benefit of the Iran-P5+1 talks is to make the most stupid individuals in Iran understand that the US [cannot be trusted],\" said Ahmad Khatami, in his Friday prayer sermon at Tehran University. </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In Iran, Obama\'s letter has been largely ignored with the hard-line <em>Keyhan</em> editorial <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://kayhan.ir/fa/news/28808\" target=\"_blank\">denying its existence</a>. Yet, in Khamenei\'s latest speeches, there is a slight change in tone. The usual anti-US rhetoric is there but the focus seems to have shifted to advocating unity between Sunnis and Shia Muslims in Iraq and Syria.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\"The two sides should be careful,\" he said in his speech on October 13. \"They should not provoke each other\'s feelings, they should not insult each other\'s holy beliefs and they should not fuel the fire of discord between Muslim tribes and groups.\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">This appeal for calm could be in response to Obama\'s reported request for collaboration over fighting ISIL.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Obama\'s letter to Khamenei would not make or break the nuclear deal but it will strike the right chord. It would be seen as respecting Iran, and as offering a hand of friendship - just as US Secretary of State John Kerry did when meeting his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, in Muscat. It may not bring in full trust but it would go some way in keeping Khamenei\'s approval intact while the negotiations are taking place and while Iran\'s blocked assets are gradually being released in compliance with the Geneva accord. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Positive overtures by Iran\'s key negotiatior, Abbas Araqchi, who is close to the supreme leader, could also indicate that the letter has been well received.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><STRONG><i>Factors at play</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">The letter would also underpin a positive combination of factors at play at the talks: In Iran for the first time, the talks carry the tacit approval of the establishment, the tone of the media has become more conciliatory, and President Hassan Rouhani, one of the main architects of talks with the US over the past decade, is keen to put his signature on the deal.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">In the US, Obama and the Democrats badly need one success story before they leave the White House.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">In the EU, there is a strong resolve to reach a conclusion. A number of veterans of European foreign policy have recently signed a joint statement urging the EU3+3 and Iran to ensure an agreement is reached by the designated deadline.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\"All sides have the option to walk away,\" says the statement, \"but they do so knowing that the alternatives are far worse\".</span><a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/05/time-for-nuclear-deal-with-iran-now\" target=\"_blank\"><br /></a></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Another positive is the element of the highly experienced set of negotiators at work. The US and Iranian foreign ministers, together with former EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, have worked long and hard in over seven rounds of talks in Vienna and one more in New York to make a success of it. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">This is further strengthened by the involvement of Russia, China, and Germany. Just before coming to Muscat, Kerry met his Russian and Chinese counterparts at the meeting of APEC in China and before that he met French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius in Paris. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">There are two main remaining problems. First is the concern that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has raised on the eve of the Muscat talks. While </span>it confirms in its latest report that Iran is complying with an agreement to curb uranium enrichment, IAEA says in a <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-29957334\" target=\"_blank\">confidential report to its members</a> that Iran has not made any progress in its investigation into possible military dimensions of the programme. <span lang=\"EN-GB\">Although the deal being sought by world powers is separate to the IAEA\'s investigation, the report would no doubt raise questions.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><STRONG><i>Red lines</i></STRONG><br /></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The second problem is that the Iranian negotiators have their strict set of red lines including the sanctity of Iran\'s nuclear industry. They have also been told they must demand the full removal of sanctions - something that is unlikely to get congressional approval. Yet Iran\'s deputy chief negotiator seems to be optimistic.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\"<a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13930817001102\" target=\"_blank\">Muscat talks can open the path</a>,\" said Araqchi, adding that \"on the issue of sanctions there are four channels\". He is referring to the two sets of US sanctions plus the UN and EU sanctions. He is not saying it directly but could be implying that some of these channels must be utilised in the talks. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Given the seriousness of the sanctions issue for Iran, and the equal concerns of the countries of 5+1 about the verifications issue, it is very unlikely that a complete deal would be struck by the deadline of November 24. Yet, if an agreement could be reached in Muscat in regards to dropping some of the sanctions - say those by the EU and the UN - in return for an acceptable level of information from Iran, then it is probable that a partial or temporary deal could later be reached in Vienna outlining the basis for future adjustments.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Dr Massoumeh Torfeh is former director of strategic communication at the UN Assistance Mission for Afghanistan (UNAMA) and is currently a research associate at the London School of Economics and Political Science, specialising in Iran, Afghanistan and Central Asia.</span></i></STRONG></em></p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/images/2014/11/10//2014111065048327734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/images/2014/11/10/2014111065048327734_20.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-10 19:41:58','Massoumeh Torfeh',23.61000000,58.54000000,NULL,NULL),(785,'201411962317120739','http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/yemen-president-future-hangs-thread-201411962317120739.html','Yemen president\'s future hangs by a thread','Latest standoff reflects the ongoing power struggle between President Hadi, his predecessor and the Houthis.','<p><STRONG><i> Sanaa, Yemen - </i></STRONG> Despite having managed to form a new government, Yemeni President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who  <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/yemen-swear-new-government-2014118223745207779.html\" target=\"_blank\"> presided over the swearing-in session </a>  on Sunday, appears to be facing his toughest challenge yet as he approaches a third year in office.</p>\r\n<p>On Saturday, Hadi, the last of a group of leaders elected in the wake of the Arab Spring, <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/yemen-president-sacked-from-party-leadership-201411893259364727.html\" target=\"_blank\"> was dismissed from his own party </a> , the General People\'s Congress (GPC), in response <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/video/middleeast/2014/11/un-imposes-sanctions-yemen-ex-president-2014117233551618637.html\" target=\"_blank\"> to a UN Security Council resolution imposing sanctions </a> on former President Ali Abdullah Saleh and two members of the rebel Houthi movement.

On September 26, 43 students from the Escuela Normal Rural Raul Isidro Burgos, which is located in Ayotzinapa, Guerrero, were on their way to a protest when they disappeared. Subsequent revelations allege the involvement of the mayor, who had ordered the police to turn the students over to Guerreros Unidos, a local drug gang. This pointed to the close relationship between government officials and \"narcos\", a relationship that has been documented around the country and in human rights violations that implicate the army and police in cases of disappearance and murder. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Authorities, in a series of missteps, announced the discovery of the students\' bodies in a <em>narcofosa</em> (graves of drug-gang victims), only to find that the mass grave contained different bodies. And then more narcofosas were found in the area, but none of them contained the students\' bodies. The graves made the widespread problem of disappearance impossible to ignore.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Image problem</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">When President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, he began to sell violence as an image problem (as in, it doesn\'t exist, the media just shows it too much). He exerted pressure on media outlets <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2014/10/03-renewed-violence-mexico-negroponte\" target=\"_blank\">not to report on or show photos of homicides</a>, and he immediately went to work cooking the books on homicide and disappearance statistics. </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Three months after a flashy news conference in which his government announced a steep drop in disappearances, the government was forced to revise its numbers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">But P<span lang=\"ES-TRAD\">ena Nieto</span> did a good enough job that <em>Time</em> magazine put him on its February cover under the title \"Saving Mexico\". Human rights organisations estimate that since 2006,<a href=\"http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/7/5/closer-look-at-massacreinmexicorevealsglimpseofcorruption.html\"> </a>as many as <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/7/5/closer-look-at-massacreinmexicorevealsglimpseofcorruption.html\" target=\"_blank\">200,000 people have disappeared</a>, although the government only admits to 26,000 disappearances. The truth is that there are no reliable statistics because the government has no interest in tracking them. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">When I interviewed Juarez journalist Julian Cardona in 2013 for a film about violence in the Mexican media, he argued: \"The media can be understood as a company that makes tacit or under the table agreements with governments to control how newspapers cover such government entities. You don\'t know who is behind the violence.\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"ES-TRAD\">Pena Nieto\'s </span>close ties with Televisa, the largest media company in Latin America, have been widely documented and even earned him the nickname the \"Televisa candidate\" during the elections.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">To create confusion, the Pena Nieto administration has pursued the strategy of making splashy high profile narco arrests, and of blaming all criminal activity, including murders and disappearances, on the fact that everyone involved was part of the drug trafficking business. This approach makes victims responsible for the violence they suffer, and it is promoted in the media in a way that makes all victims become suspects. People then are afraid to report disappearances or other violence because they know they will be investigated and perhaps tortured and forced to confess to the very crimes they reported. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">On November 7, the Mexican Attorney General Jes<span lang=\"ES-TRAD\">u</span>s Murillo Karam continued to follow this strategy in his news conference on the 43 disappeared students. He blamed the drug gang Guerreros Unidos and described how they <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2014/11/mexico-gang-suspects-confess-mass-killing-2014117222348528637.html\" target=\"_blank\">chopped up the bodies and burned them on a trash pile</a>. Making drug gangs seem inhuman and barbaric is a strategy for deflecting attention from the fact that the drug gangs were apparently working with the police and the mayor to deal with the protesting students. Conveniently for the government, the drug gang left behind no remains to be identified. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Unanswered questions</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Several questions remain unanswered: Why did the mayor order the police to arrest the students and hand them over to the gang? Why did the governor of the state fail to investigate the disappearances? This is yet another example among the many human rights abuses that have been documented in Mexico under Pen<span lang=\"ES-TRAD\">a Nieto</span>, in which the government and the narcos appear to be working together to orchestrate the murder and disappearance of protesters and other dissidents.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">At the press conference Murillo Karam was dismissive when asked questions, and he tried to cut the press conference short by saying \"I\'m tired.\" This set off outrage on Twitter that trended worldwide under the hashtag #YaMeCanse (#Imtired): \"How can they declare 43 people dead when they only have bags of trash and they have no DNA? #YaMeCanse?\" asked Mariano Castillo.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The main point is that this incident is not the first of its kind in Mexico; it is one of a <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/26658-san-fernando-migrant-massacre-how-us-mexican-and-latin-american-governments-share-responsibility\" target=\"_blank\">series of documented massacres</a> in which there is evidence that the government and organised crime worked hand in hand to disappear protesters (mothers protesting the disappearance of their daughters, workers protesting inhumane treatment, students protesting a lack of educational opportunities). Because there is such tight government <span lang=\"EN-GB\">control of the media and because the country continues to be one of the most dangerous places in the world for journalists, this extreme violence gets silenced in the media. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">When I interviewed </span>Mexican journalist Sergio Gonz<span lang=\"ES-TRAD\">alez Rodriguez in 2010 about how he was kidnapped, beaten, and left on the side of the road after reporting on the murder of women in Juarez</span>, he said he believes<span lang=\"ES-TRAD\"> that narcos form, </span>\"a network of enormous scope that reach up to the highest public office in Mexico.

This year\'s fashion choice remains a mystery.</p>\r\n<p>The event culminates on Tuesday with a formal leaders\' summit.</p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/10//2014111021435580734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/10//2014111021435580734_2.jpg',NULL,NULL,'2014-11-10 13:39:52','Al Jazeera',39.90421100,116.40739500,NULL,NULL);

The Cold War was over. There were parties and celebrations, laughter and tears of joy. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">But among communist supporters in Western Europe, images of armed guards standing idly by as elated East Germans danced on the barricades were a source of consternation, not jubilation. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">More than a thousand kilometres from the Brandenburg Gate, in the Scottish mining town of Cowdenbeath, Mary Doherty sat sobbing in front of the evening news on November 9, 1989. For decades she ran the weekly Socialist Sunday School. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"Her world was shattered,\" recalls veteran local communist Jackie Allan. \"Everything was the Soviet Union, then it was gone.\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">A few kilometres away in </span>Ballingry, a small hamlet of post-war suburban pebbledash terrace houses at the foot of green hills, councillor Willie Clarke remembers being \"stunned\" when the Berlin Wall fell. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"It was something you didn\'t see happening, and it happened so quickly. It took a long time to recover,\" says Clarke.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Standing in Cowdenbeath today, its quiet streets dotted with \"to let\" signs and bargain stores, it is hard to imagine that this was once a hotbed of communist agitation. In the 1920s, the red sandstone town hall - still the most impressive building on High Street - flew the Red Flag on the anniversary of the Russian revolution. At the time, the government in London feared that any left-wing insurrection in Britain would start in Cowdenbeath.   </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">As late as 1973, communists won 12 council seats in Lochgelly and Cowdenbeath. Clarke was among the councillors elected that day. Remarkably, Clarke, now in his late 70s and having lost his left ear to cancer, is still a local councillor for Ballingry. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Clarke is technically an independent, but he campaigns on an avowedly communistic platform. \"All the literature that goes out is communist,\" says the craggy-faced septuagenarian. \"Nobody can say I\'m trying to gild the lily. I\'m still a communist.\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In the last local elections in 2012, Clarke was returned on the first round of voting. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Communist curiosity</span></i></STRONG><STRONG><i></i></STRONG></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Communists were not always a curiosity in UK politics. In the 1945 general election, the Communist Party of Great Britain took 14.6 percent of the vote and two seats, including Willie Gallacher, whose constituency included what is now Ballingry. In local elections the following year, <span lang=\"EN-GB\">the number of communist councillors increased from 81 to 215. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">This was proven to be an electoral high-water mark for the party. Members left in droves after the Soviet invasion first of Hungary in 1956, and then of Czechoslovakia in 1968. Nevertheless, the communists remained a presence in outposts of industrial Britain, in South Wales, East London, and in the coalfields of Scotland. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In Cowdenbeath, communism was inextricably linked with the local coal mining industry. In the early years of the 19th c</span><span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">entury, rich deposits of coal were inadvertently discovered when iron ore shafts were sunk. Almost overnight Cowdenbeath, a tranquil cluster of farmers\' cottages, was transformed into a noisy, dirty, ramshackle settlement. By the turn of the 20th c</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">entury, the town\'s population had swelled to 14,000. Three-quarters of the menfolk were employed by the Fife Coal Company, Britain\'s largest mining enterprise.</span></span></p>\r\n<div class=\"mceVideoBox\" style=\"width: 330; height: 186; float: Right;\">\r\n<div id=\"bc_3882655711001\" style=\"width: 330; height: 186;\"><!-- --></div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Willie Clarke was born in Glencraig, a \"very militant\" village with a reputation for communism. Active communists included Laurence Daly, a prominent miners\' leader who would leave the Communist Party in 1956 in protest at Nikita Khrushchev\'s denunciation of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. Aged 14, he began working in the mine, and not long afterwards he joined the Communist Party.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"[Communism] caught your imagination, they were radical, wanted change, they were not prepared to accept things as they were,\" says Clarke. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>\'O</i></STRONG><STRONG><i><span lang=\"EN-GB\">pium of the people\'</span></i></STRONG><STRONG><i></i></STRONG></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Communists were renowned for their iron discipline. Local MP Willie Gallacher, the last communist in the House of Commons,</span> was<span lang=\"EN-GB\"> a lifelong teetotaller. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Willie Sharp, the first communist provost in Britain when he was elected in Cowdenbeath in 1973, did not smoke or drink. Communists decried religion \"as the opium of the people\", but party and church often operated along similar lines. Both organised community events and Sunday schools - one teaching the bible, the other political economy and the works of Karl Marx. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">The legacy of Cowdenbeath\'s communist past can still be seen today. In the adjacent suburb of Lumphinnans, people live on streets named \"Gallacher Place\" and \"Gagarin Way\". Locals call this \"Little Moscow\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Former communist activist Jack Allan recalls </span>asking his father why the family always voted communist. \"His answer was simple: \'They\'re the people who help ye the most.\' I still believe that.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The demise of communism in Cowdenbeath and the surrounding pit villages was a product of rapid economic and political change. The discovery of huge </span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">deposits of oil and gas in the North Sea hastened the demise of smaller, less productive mines across Britain. By the 1970s, most of the mining jobs in Cowdenbeath were gone. </span>Nowadays, the region has one of the highest rates of unemployment in Scotland.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Demise of communism</i></STRONG></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The fall of the Berlin Wall sounded the death knell for British communism. By the time the party voted to disband itself in 1991, there had already been numerous splits and its vote had collapsed.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">For communists in Cowdenbeath, the fall of the wall was \"like telling a Christian there was no God\", as former communist councillor Alex Maxwell put it. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">With the barrier between East and West gone, the brutal reality of life in the Soviet Union could no longer be dismissed as anti-communist propaganda. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"What you believed was happening in the Soviet Union wasn\'t happening at all. It was something different,\" says Clarke.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Four decades on, the material conditions that sustained <STRONG><i><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.scottishmining.co.uk/151.html\" target=\"_blank\">Fife\'s pit villages</a></i></STRONG> - and its communists - are gone. The mines are closed and Clarke is able to win votes not because of his belief in a new socialist order, but because he works tirelessly to get council houses renovated and community centres opened. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"People like Willie, he\'s a great guy and he gets things done,\" says Michael Payne, who works at the local community centre in Ballingry. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Clarke was instrumental in securing funding for this state-of-the-art facility that opened in 2012 to replace a series of diffuse, dilapidated facilities dotted across the adjacent pit villages.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Clarke has one last political wish: <STRONG><i><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/09/scotland-democratic-revolution-201491617241276848.html\" target=\"_blank\">Scottish independence.</a></i></STRONG> He was very active in the \"yes\" campaign in the recent referendum. Although the vote was lost, he says Scotland will become independent someday. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"If it doesn\'t happen now it\'ll be happen in the future.

These noisy protests - called <em>cacerolazo,</em> literally \"casserole\" - started recently after Spain\'s constitutional court suspended a proposed non-binding poll on Catalan independence.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">A vote, however, will go ahead as planned on Sunday, Catalan President Artur Mas has said. In Barcelona, <em>cacerolazo</em> protesters have vowed to keep beating their kitchenware until it does.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"All peoples have the right to decide their future,\" Mas told reporters on Wednesday. The vote was initially intended as a legally binding referendum on independence from Spain, but was downgraded to a symbolic \"consultation\" after an intervention from the country\'s<a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/29/catalonia-independence-referendum-spain-court-vote%20\" target=\"_blank\"> constitutional court</a>. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Now, it has been watered down further. Sunday\'s poll will be \"a participatory process\" with no formal standing, run entirely by volunteers instead of the Catalan government.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Future of Catalonia</i></STRONG></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has called any attempt to hold a vote on leaving Spain \"anti-democratic\", saying Spain\'s constitution prevents any region from unilaterally taking decisions that affect all Spaniards.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Madrid and Barcelona have been at loggerheads since July 2010, when a new statute on Catalan autonomy was struck down by Spain\'s constitutional court.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Support for independence has risen dramatically in the wake of what was widely seen as an attempt to curb the power of Catalan\'s regional parliament. Just under half of Catalans are in favour of leaving Spain, according to opinion polls last month. More than one-fifth of respondents said they were recent converts to the nationalist cause.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Rocio Martinez-Sampere Rodrigo, a socialist parliamentarian at the Catalan assembly, is opposed to independence but says a referendum is needed to settle the future of Catalonia, a region of 7.5 million people that stretches for 400km from the French border to neighbouring Valencia.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Martinez-Sampere Rodrigo, who favours a federal arrangement for Catalonia, blames the Spanish prime minister for unwittingly building Catalan support for leaving Spain.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"Rajoy has never approached this in a political way, he is just saying \'no, no, no\' to everything,\" she told Al Jazeera. \"If you say \'no\' to everything, people will say the only solution is independence.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">But Rafael Lopez, a Catalan member of parliament from Rajoy\'s conservative Popular Party, said any referendum on independence would be illegal.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"The Spanish constitution is quite clear on this point, the unity of Spain cannot be questioned,\" <span>Lopez </span>said.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Sunday\'s poll will have \"no legal validity nor democratic guarantee\", Lopez added.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Nevertheless, Catalan nationalists have been busy preparing for the vote. Television adverts and mailshots have carried election information. Pro-independence memes have ignited on social media.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Widespread frustration</i></STRONG></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">An estimated 40,000 people have volunteered to staff polling centres across Catalonia. Expatriates in around 40 cities worldwide - including London, Paris, Mexico City, and Montreal - will be able to vote at offices of international Catalan delegations.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The ballot will have the same two-part question that was planned for the suspended referendum. The first is whether voters want Catalonia to be a state. The second is whether they want it to be an independent state. As in the recent independence referendum in Scotland, 16 and 17-year olds will be able to participate, too.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The clamour for Catalan independence has grown amid Spain\'s financial crisis and widespread frustration with the central government\'s reluctance to grant more powers to the Catalan parliament, which was re-established in 1980. Recent attempts by Madrid to interfere with Catalan education have further stoked passions.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Catalonia is the country\'s most prosperous and most economically productive region and accounts for about a quarter of Spain\'s taxes - far more than its share of Spain\'s population.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Catalonia\'s fiscal deficit - the difference between what it pays to Madrid and, after taking some funds to pay state costs, the money it gets back - runs at between 7 and 10 percent of the region\'s GDP. Such disparities have deepened resentment.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\'V\' for vote</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">On September 11 this year, Catalonia\'s national holiday, hundreds of thousands of independence supporters converged on Barcelona, forming a huge \"V\" - for vote - in Catalan red and yellow. Now nationalists are hoping a large demonstration of strength on Sunday will show both Madrid and the world that their demands are not going away.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"The goal is to keep the pressure on Madrid and to demonstrate to the world that the process is alive and it\'s not just an invention of Artur Mas,\" said Marc Vidal, foreign editor of pro-independence Catalan newspaper <em>ARA</em>.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The vast majority are expected to vote \"yes\", but turnout will be crucial. Two million votes, about 30 percent of the electorate, would be a \"big result\" for the nationalists, said Vidal.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Liz Castro, a supporter of Catalan independence in Barcelona, said the attitude of the Spanish government will only strengthen nationalists\' resolve to turnout on Sunday.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"I think the fact that the Spanish government is making it so difficult to voice your opinion is making people angry, and making people determined to vote,\" <span>Castro </span>said.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Supporters of the union with Spain argued independence would be disastrous for Catalonia - and for Europe.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"If regions like Catalonia, the Flemish region, Lombardy, Veneto, some German states or Corsica decide to secede, Europe would be cut into pieces, and that would go against its philosophy,\" said Josep Ramon Bosch, president of pro-union association Societat Civil Catalana.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">While there is little doubt about the outcome of Sunday\'s consultation, a long-term solution to the Catalan question is much less clear cut. Spain\'s national politics has been turned on its head following a poll this week that put Podemos, a youthful leftist-only party formed in January, ahead of both Rajoy\'s Popular Party and the main opposition <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/fc683a00-6362-11e4-9a79-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3IHlmXWS3\" target=\"_blank\">Socialist Party nationally</a>.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Some Catalan commentators expect Artur Mas to call early elections to the Catalan parliament, in an effort to secure a resounding majority in favour of independence and increase pressure on Madrid. But Mas himself has been weakened by a tax-evasion scandal involving the founder of his ruling Convergence and Union party. A recent poll showed the more fervently pro-independence Republican Left of Catalonia well ahead among Catalan voters.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">For Catalan nationalists, however, the big question is how Madrid will react to the latest salvo in the campaign for a referendum on independence.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\"There is a general feeling that the Spanish government doesn\'t know what is going on here,\" said independence activist Castro. \"I don\'t think they really realise what people are ready to do here.\"</span></p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/8/2014118134646830734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/Images/2014/11/8/2014118134646830734_20.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-09 03:53:03','Peter Geoghegan',40.41677540,-3.70379020,NULL,NULL),(823,'2014118783043576','http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/call-ease-saudi-women-driving-ban-2014118783043576.html','Saudi denies it may ease ban on women drivers','Local media quotes head of king\'s advisory council as saying claim it was to ease ban for women over 30 is misinformed.','<p>Local media in Saudi Arabia have said a story published by the Associated Press news agency stating that the advisory council to Saudi Arabia\'s king had recommended easing a ban on women driving in the country is a \"fabrication\".</p>\r\n<p>Media quoted Mohammed Abdullah Al-Muhanna, the head of the Shura council, as calling the report \"misinformed\" and clearly showing a \"lack of authenticity\". </p>\r\n<p>Earlier on Saturday, AP reported that the council, whose recommendations are not obligatory on the government, had reportedly endorsed that women over the age of 30 would be allowed to drive with numerous restrictions, including a curfew.</p>\r\n<p>AP said a council member, who had spoken on the condition of anonymity, had said that the recommendations were made in a secret, closed session held in the past month.</p>\r\n<p>Under the suggestions, only women over 30 would be allowed to drive and they would need permission from a male relative, usually a husband or father, and if they lack those then a brother or son.</p>\r\n<p>They would be allowed to drive from 7am to 8pm on Saturday through Wednesday and noon to 8pm on the weekend - Thursday and Friday.</p>\r\n<p>The conditions also require that the woman driver wear conservative dress and no make-up, the official said.</p>\r\n<p>Within cities, they could drive without a male relative in the car, but outside the cities, a male relative\'s presence would be required.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Female activists</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>The council had also reportedly said that a \"female traffic department\" would have to be created to deal with female drivers if their cars broke down or other problems and to issue fines.</p>\r\n<p><span>The 150-member Shura Council is appointed by the king, drawing on various </span><span>sectors of society to act as the closest thing to a parliament in the conservative </span><span>kingdom, though it has no legislative powers.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>King Abdullah has appointed women </span><span>to it for the first time, and there are now 30 female members.</span></p>\r\n<p>The driving ban has long forced families to hire live-in drivers for women.

Now the US debt is almost $18tn, which is slightly higher than the size of the whole economy.</p>\r\n<p>But we have been here before: The Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s was triggered by a build-up of credit and it needed what was, at the time, the biggest bailouts in history.</p>\r\n<p>At the heart of the problem were the banks and corporations, borrowing money for overseas institutions. And yet foreign banks loans in 2006 grew from $210bn to $260bn.</p>\r\n<p>Japan\'s asset bubble that popped in the 1990s was also fuelled by cheap money with consumers and corporations taking on huge levels of debt. Japan\'s consumer debt rose nine-fold to 67 trillion yen in 1991. And Japanese industrial companies raised $638bn through the stock market, driving the biggest spending spree since 1945.</p>\r\n<p>As all these recessions seem to have the same starting point, that people and banks take on too much debt, what drives our economy?

The plan will release funds to repair and reconstruct more than 116 kilometres of roads, six airports, 35 seaports, nearly 20,000 classrooms, as well as hundreds of local health centres and municipal buildings.</span></div>\r\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><br /></span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The plan also calls for the construction of more than 200,000 permanent housing units in the heavily affected areas.

The nearest town is 240km away. Here, the Hindukush, Karakorum and Pamir jostle for space. In stark contrast to the past, this remote region has become known for unique sporting events like freestyle horse and yak polo. </p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Main attraction</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i></i></STRONG>The Shandur polo festival in Chitral was the largest sporting attraction across the Hindukush-Karakorum region until a few years ago. Now, it has a new rival in yak polo.</p>\r\n<p>Since 2005, yak polo has become the main attraction of a local festival called ‘Jashan-e-Broghol’ held every July for the last 15 years. This event took shape due to efforts of local youth’s aim of promoting tourism in this far-off region.</p>\r\n<p>Umer Rafee, president of the Chiantar Welfare Society, was the brain behind the festival that included events of the Buzkushi, horse polo, donkey polo, yak race among others.</p>\r\n<p>“The aim of starting this event was to highlight the tourism potential of the area, one of the most beautiful areas of the country with its pristine lakes, glaciers and huge swaths of pastures,” Rafee told Al Jazeera.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Symbol of celebration</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i></i></STRONG>“Yak polo has now become the main attraction of the festival. Yak, being a wild animal, is first domesticated in Broghil when it’s two years old. The Wakhis pierce its nose, pass a rope called nash through the piercing and then the animal is trained to move at the whims of the rider in a training period spanning over a year.”</p>\r\n<p>For the sport’s purpose, yaks aged five to eight are used. Yak polo is largely modelled after the freestyle polo that is played across Hindukush-Karakorum region. A team comprises mostly six players, while the game is divided into halves spanning 20-30 minutes each.</p>\r\n<p>The event has become a symbol of the celebration of Wakhi culture.</p>\r\n<p>“This year, around 1,500 people visited Broghil on the eve of event, including women,” added Rafee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The locals also tend to regard this event as a celebration of the yak, due to animal’s importance to the area’s economy. Its hair are used to prepare numdah rugs and the animal not only fulfils meat and milk needs of the locals but is also traded to earn hard cash by selling it to butchers – a well looked-after animal can fetch as much as $1,000.</p>\r\n<p>Broghil’s terrain is similar to adjacent region of Pamir, which is Wakhi for upland grazing ground and this rough and harsh region offers scant forage to its nomadic people due to lack of suitable vegetation cover.</p>\r\n<p>The yak suits this environment very well. It’s on its own for most part of the year and even manages to dig out grass and forage buried in deep snow. The locals have to feed the animal in January and February though when the area is buried under several feet of snow.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Neglected no more</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>The yak population across Broghil is said to be about 900. The poor man’s flock may comprise 10 but those of rich goes into triple figures.</p>\r\n<p>“Horses are very expensive and as they have to be fed and cared for throughout the year,” Amin Jan, a yak polo player from Lashkargaz village, said. He added that a local can easily spare a yak out of a pack of 10 animals for polo without causing drain on his resources.</p>\r\n<p>Dr Inayatullah Faizi, author of ‘Wakhan Corridor’, noted that yak polo was the game of shepherds, who used to play it while tending their flocks as pastime. Faizi explained that yak is used to extreme climatic conditions of the region and can traverse difficult terrain, glaciers and can ford rivers with loads up to hundreds of kilogrammes easily.</p>\r\n<p>The festival has also brought the neglected region to the attention of policy makers and development is slowly trickling into these remote valleys.</p>\r\n<p>The sport has not only brought joy to the locals but also helped the government sit up and take notice.</p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/8//20141181153687734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/8//20141181153687734_2.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-08 22:18:11','Manzoor Ali',30.37532100,69.34511600,NULL,NULL),(835,'20141187577999976','http://www.aljazeera.com/video/asia/2014/11/afghans-take-helm-hydro-power-project-20141187577999976.html','Afghans take helm of hydro-power project','Upgrade of biggest hydro-electric plant in country under way in Helmand after US delayed project for years.','<p>Engineers are planning a long awaited upgrade of the biggest hydro-electric plant in Afghanistan.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Improving power output was supposed to be a priority for NATO and the US government, but work stalled six years ago.</span></p>\r\n<p>Now the Afghan government has taken up the project.</p>\r\n<p>Al Jazeera\'s Jennifer Glasse reports from Kajaki in Helmand province.</p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/8/201411893950523580_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/Images/2014/11/8/201411893950523580_20.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-08 22:15:23','Al Jazeera',0.00000000,0.00000000,NULL,NULL),(836,'20141171851419790','http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/techknow/2014/11/inside-csi-20141171851419790.html','Inside the CSI','We explore how new techniques in forensic science can influence the ways we solve crimes.','\r\n\r\n<p>In many ways, the crime-fighting of the future is with us today, and new techniques in forensic science can influence the ways we solve cases.</p>\r\n<div>TechKnow explores the cold case of a murdered young woman that is reopened after 19 years, thanks to developments in Touch DNA technology.</div>\r\n<p>Crystal Dilworth takes a look at the innovations that enabled it to be solved and goes to the John Jay School of Criminal Justice to learn more about the latest in forensic technology.</p>\r\n<p>Next, we look at 3D printing - or additive manufacturing - which in recent years has moved from the commercial to the consumer market.

Twenty years before that, he was knocked out by Ali despite wearing the favourite’s tag.</p>\r\n<p>A total of 81 fights and 76 wins – 68 of them KOs – it’d be a safe bet to consider Foreman one of the bravest on the planet.</p>\r\n<p>“I was always afraid in the ring,” Foreman confirms. “You corner me and that’s when I hit you. Like a cornered cat. I’d just hit you out of fright. As a boxer, you need fear. It’s the art of self-defence. Once you lose that, there’s no telling what can happen to you.</p>\r\n<p>“The only time I wasn’t afraid was when i fought Ali and that’s when I should’ve been afraid. I wasn’t scared then. No butterflies at all. I thought this was going to be the easiest fight of my life.”</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>KO-ed</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>Growing up in Marshall, Texas, boxing was all Foreman knew. A poor family, not much food on the table and lack of opportunity paved way for a successful boxing career.</p>\r\n<p>“Boxing was a way out. I talk about it because I’ve had a lot of success.”</p>\r\n<p>Foreman held the gloves he had bought on stage with him and added: “These little things took me all over the world and gave me a chance to be successful”.</p>\r\n<p>His success streak was halted at ‘The Rumble in the Jungle’, the title fight against Ali.</p>\r\n<p>Foreman was knocked out in the eighth round.</p>\r\n<p>He was the undefeated world heavyweight champion. Ali was a former heavyweight champion but the challenger here.</p>\r\n<p>“I was overconfident. I was told I was the favourite and I believed it. I figured I will knock him out in three rounds max. I threw everything I had in those three rounds. He even asked me in the sixth round: ‘Is that everything you got?’.</p>\r\n<p>“I remember thinking, yes that’s about it.”</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><br /></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>The final comeback</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>Foreman retired a few years later and worked as a minister at the church while also helping kids get off the streets. The hunger for another shot at the belt remained. He decided to return.</p>\r\n<p>But more than the hunger and to take care of unfinished business, Foreman needed cash to survive.</p>\r\n<p>“I was broke. Boxing was my only profession. I had to go back in the ring and when I did, I was this 45 year old in the ring with someone young enough to be my son.”</p>\r\n<p>This time, in 1994, Foreman got a shot at the title but as an underdog. For nine rounds, he remained true to the tag before unleashing a series of punches, culminating in a short right hand that caught Moorer on the chin.</p>\r\n<p>Foreman had knocked out his opponent and regained the belt he had lost to Ali almost 20 years ago. At 45, he became the oldest boxer to win the World heavyweight Championship.</p>\r\n<p>Foreman was inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame while the IBRO rates him as the eighth greatest heavyweight of all-time.</p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/8//201411810435578734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/8//201411810435578734_2.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-08 21:53:05','Faras Ghani',48.36535200,-96.67442400,NULL,NULL),(838,'20126491020595946','http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/listeningpost/2012/06/20126491020595946.html','Listening Post','A weekly programme that examines and dissects the world\'s media.','','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2014/11/8/2014118104315734734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/Images/2014/11/8/2014118104315734734_20.jpg',NULL,NULL,'2014-11-08 21:43:33','Al Jazeera',0.00000000,0.00000000,NULL,NULL),(839,'201411891117715870','http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/libyan-airspace-being-frequently-violated-201411891117715870.html','Libyan airspace being \'frequently violated\'','Forces allied to recently revived government say they detected reoccurring violation by cargo planes carrying arms.','<p>The Libyan armed forces allied to the recently revived government says it has detected a reoccurring violation of its airspace by cargo planes it said were carrying weapons to armed groups from Belarus.</p>\r\n<p>In a statement, the chief of armed forces said that the planes were entering the airspace of embattled North African country through Egypt and other neighbouring countries.</p>\r\n<p>It said that the aircraft carried weapons and ammunition to support the Qaqaa and the Sawaeq brigades, two of Libya’s most powerful militias allied to a rival government based in the east of the country.</p>\r\n<p>In the statement, the armed forces loyal to the so-called National Salvation government based in the capital, Tripoli, threatened to shoot down such planes \"without warning\".</p>\r\n<p>The National Salvation government, which lost the June general elections, was reinstated by armed groups that seized the capital in August.</p>\r\n<p>The internationally-backed government of Prime Minister Abdullah Thinni and the parliament that resulted from June elections were forced to operate in the eastern city of Tobruk near the border with Egypt.</p>\r\n<p>A Supreme Court decision on Thursday ruled in favour of the Tripoli-based government, ordering Thinni’s government and the parliament be dissolved after deeming the elections unconstitutional.</p>\r\n<p>Bitter clashes have been raging for months between rival militias supporting the two governments, leaving hundreds killed and thousands displaced.</p>\r\n<p>The National Salvation government has repeatedly accused Egypt and United Arab Emirates of supporting Thinni and the armed militias allied to it.</p>\r\n<p>The two countries have been also blamed for carrying out air strikes against militias bases in Tripoli.</p>\r\n<p>Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt are viewed as having a common goal in trying to contain or eradicate political Islam.

This was not the first time Bouteflika travelled to France for medical reasons: In 2005, he went there for surgery after being diagnosed with stomach cancer,  according to a leaked US diplomatic cable.</p>\r\n<p>Despite his fragile health, Bouteflika was re-elected for a fourth consecutive term in April. Opposition parties say his allies need him to remain in power to safeguard their own interests.</p>\r\n<p>“They absolutely want and need to preserve the political status quo. Otherwise they would expose themselves to criticism or charges of corruption,” Sofiane Djilali, founder of the opposition party Jil Jadid (“New Generation” in Arabic), told Al Jazeera.</p>\r\n<p>Djilali - who boycotted the last presidential election, saying it was rigged - says the country is now experiencing a power vacuum.  Bouteflika has rarely been seen in public since April, and has met only occasionally with Prime Minister Abdelmalek Sellal and Deputy Defence Minister General Ahmed Gaid Salah.</p>\r\n<p>Under Article 88 of Algeria\'s national constitution , a president can be impeached for medical reasons. However,  “this is not likely to happen since there is no independent constitutional justice. Three of the members of the Constitutional Council are appointed by the President.

There is no more authority to counter his power.  But, with his absence, this system does not work anymore. Bouteflika\'s sickness paralyses everything,” Benabbou added.</p>\r\n<p>As result, the real power lies with a shadowy consortium of senior military and intelligence figures, as well as with Bouteflika\'s family, especially his younger brother Said, experts and opponents say. </p>\r\n<p>“This situation is not sustainable,\" Djilali warned. \"T he Algerian regime may collapse sooner than what we expect.\"</p>\r\n<div><hr /></div>\r\n<div><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/08/bouteflika-debate-consumes-algerian-politics-2014811641197874.html\" target=\"_blank\"> <span style=\"font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 16px;\"> RELATED: Bouteflika debate consumes Algerian politics </span></a></div>\r\n<div><hr /></div>\r\n<p>The recent police protest has reopened the succession debate in Algeria, with experts calling it a new episode in the battle for influence within the ruling oligarchy, including the army, the intelligence service and other factions.  This could explain why the protesters, demonstrating in their blue uniforms, called for the dismal of General Abdelghani Hamel, the head of the national police force, who is considered one of Bouteflika\'s potential successors.</p>\r\n<p>“How come the DRS [Algeria\'s powerful state intelligence service] didn\'t warn of an imminent threat to security of this kind?” Fabiani asked. \" There are two possible explanations: Either they have been weakened to the point where they are unable to report about this type of internal problem, or they avoided doing that on purpose, to put pressure on President Bouteflika and the various factions linked to him.”  </p>\r\n<p>At this stage, however, it remains unclear who may succeed the ailing incumbent.</p>\r\n<p>“The more a potential candidate talks about his presidential ambitions, the less likely he is to be chosen as Bouteflika\'s successor,” Louisa Dris Ait Hamadouche, a political science professor at the University of Algiers, told Al Jazeera.</p>\r\n<p>The names of two close confidantes of the president are mentioned regularly in the group of potential successors: former Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia, currently Minister of State in charge of the president\'s office, and Bouteflika\'s brother, Said.</p>\r\n<p>“The former would be a more consensual figure, able to appeal to a wider constituency than Said,” Fabiani said.  “However, Said is where ultimately power lies at this moment and he is concerned with the survival of his power after his brother is gone.\"</p>','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/images/2014/11/6//2014116115118203734_20.jpg','http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/318/480/mritems/images/2014/11/6/2014116115118203734_20.jpg',NULL,'Al Jazeera','2014-11-08 19:39:07','Al Jazeera',0.00000000,0.00000000,NULL,NULL),(845,'201411654947478','http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/11/nigeria-ebola-myth-white-saviours-201411654947478.html','Nigeria, Ebola and the myth of white saviours','Contrary to the dominant Ebola foreign intervention narrative, Africans are not waiting to be rescued by white saviours.','<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">In a 2012 article published by <em>The Atlantic</em>, Nigerian writer Teju Cole exposed the white saviour industrial complex for what it is: a pathology of white privilege. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">According to Cole, white saviours fundamentally believe they are indispensable to the very existence of those on the receiving end of their \"interventions\".

The white saviour complex has placed a premium on foreign expertise, while negating domestic capabilities.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">We\'ve been assailed with images of mostly white foreigners flown out of the Ebola \"hot zone\" with the promise of expert care abroad.

Yet, Ugandan and Congolese specialists, who contained the virus repeatedly in their own countries, have been sidelined in the mainstream international press. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Deliberately silenced</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Indian writer and human rights activist Arundathi Roy once said, \"there is no such thing as the voiceless, only the deliberately silenced or the preferably unheard\". Indeed, narratives about African ingenuity, African agency, and African heroism in the age of Ebola have been preferably unheard. As an African proverb aptly puts it: \"Until the lion learns to write, tales of the hunt shall always glorify the hunter.\" </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Most recently Nigeria positioned itself as a lion that completely unsettled the narrative around Ebola and the white saviour complex. As the regional West African hegemon and Africa\'s fastest growing economy, Nigeria contained Ebola in three months without foreign intervention. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">While the US has been scrambling to address the few cases of Ebola on its shores with a series of policy missteps, Nigeria showed that it could be done by an African country on its own terms. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">With 31 percent of overall healthcare spending accounted for by the federal government in 2012 alone, Nigeria used infrastructure and systems already in place to fight polio, to contain Ebola. Institutions such as the Nigerian Center for Disease Control, the Nigerian Field Epidemiology Training Program, and the Lagos State Ministry of Health responded quickly by quarantining and treating suspected Ebola patients, tracing the contacts of those infected, and launching a massive public awareness campaign about how to avoid further transmission of the virus. With more doctors than Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone combined, Nigeria also galvanised the support of healthcare workers who had previously been on strike. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Beyond Nigeria\'s technical expertise and rapid response, equally important is the country\'s unique brand of superiority that fundamentally challenges the white saviour complex. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Quite naturally, detractors attempted to undermine Nigeria\'s success. When the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the country Ebola-free a few weeks ago, the fanfare around this feat was short-lived. I even sensed some unspoken incredulity. Folks were quick to react that Nigeria wasn\'t completely out of the woods yet, that there could be a resurgence of Ebola. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Local, not international efforts</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Some narratives erroneously attributed Nigeria\'s success to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the WHO, and the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Yet, Nigerian novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie responded with a sharp smack-down of this \"lie\". She openly criticised <em>The </em><em>Washington Post</em> and <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em> for deliberating concealing the fact that local, not international efforts, had contained Ebola. For instance, it was a Nigerian woman, Dr Ameyo Adadevoh, who insisted on isolating the country\'s first Ebola patient before eventually succumbing to the virus herself. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Less incredulous individuals praised Nigeria, wondering why they weren\'t being consulted about the do\'s and don\'ts of Ebola containment. Consultations with Nigerians were largely shirked to the side because they invalidated the white saviour complex. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">One thing Ebola has exposed about the white saviour complex is that it is voracious and unapologetic. It simplifies complexity, appropriates ideas without crediting the source, upstages local efforts that preceded it, thrives on \"I\" statements, and soaks up media attention. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">In her celebrated essay, \"Can the subaltern speak?\", Gayatri Spivak rails against the problematic narrative of \"white men saving brown women from brown men\". In actuality, no one has the capacity to \"save\" another human being. Believing that one can is the greatest form of self-delusion and narcissism. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Contrary to the dominant Ebola foreign intervention narrative, Liberians, Guineans, and Sierra Leoneans are not waiting around idle, eager to be rescued by white saviours. While we welcome genuine collaboration, we remain our own heroes and heroines. The fact that more than 200 local healthcare workers died from Ebola is a testament to that heroism. They risked their lives long before international actors woke up from their slumber.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">No externally driven intervention narrative can change that fact, as Nigeria has proven.
