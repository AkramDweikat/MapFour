Race issues took centre stage on America\'s televisions and in its newspapers.</p>\r\n<p>But many voices accused the mainstream media of giving too much prominence to the potential for violence and not enough to the decision itself. Young black Americans used #BlackTwitter to take journalists to task on their coverage and provide their own version of the truth. Even US President Barack Obama and the prosecutor in the case had critical words for the media.</p>\r\n<p>Talking to us about the Ferguson story this week are: Malkia Cyril, founder and executive director of the Center for Media Justice who has led a number of campaigns for racial and economic justice; journalist Mikki Kendall who writes about race and feminist issues; veteran journalist Richard Prince, from the Maynard Institute for Journalism Education. Prince is known for a landmark complaint he brought against discriminatory practices at the <em>Washington Post</em> in 1972; and Sarah Kendzior, a reporter and anthropologist who has been named the best online journalist in St Louis.</p>\r\n<p>Other stories on our <em>radar</em>: Justice is delayed in the Philippines as another witness is killed in the trial over the 2009 murders of 32 journalists; an outspoken journalist in China has gone on trial for revealing state secrets, as a Chinese newspaper reprimands university lecturers for portraying the country in a negative light; Iranian-Canadian blogger Hossein Derakhshan has been released from prison in Tehran after six years behind bars.</p>\r\n<p>This week\'s feature: What is in a font? Typography, the way letters are dressed, the way words are designed may seem secondary to the meaning of the words they house. But form affects content. And in the news media, it affects the authority and the credibility of the stories being told. Helvetica conveys more neutrality than Lucida. Arial more sobriety than comic sans. Then there is the global angle to this story – designers of non-western fonts are up against the homogenising effects of a market dominated by Latin script. <em>The Listening Post\'</em>s Marcela Pizarro examines how the choice of typography affects the way audiences perceive the news.</p>\r\n<p>Our closing video this week: Making connections online at the expense of connecting with our fellow humans. A rapper who goes by the name of Prince Ea has made a video called \'<a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRl8EIhrQjQ\" target=\"_blank\">Can We Autocorrect Humanity</a>\', reminding us all what we are missing when we spend all our time with technology.

It\'s just a disease that exists there. Like, are we going to be blamed for inventing malaria too? If there is an Ebola outbreak in the Western world, will the media in the West treat it the same way?\"</p>\r\n<p>She also expressed her frustration with the way Western media portray Africa as a continent steeped in violence, victimhood and corruption.</p>\r\n<p>\"A success story in Africa doesn\'t interest any media,\" she says. \"They are so eager and hungry for horrible stories from Africa. Why? It looks like the West is the hyena, feeding on the misery of the African people. They should be ashamed doing this.\"</p>\r\n<p>On the topic of terrorism, she is crushing in her criticism of ISIL but urges an analysis of why young people are joining the group.<br /> <br />\"Everybody wants to fight ISIS. Why can\'t we just do something better for people and remove the legitimacy of all those crazy extremists that are there just for the pleasure of killing people and for power?\" she asks.</p>\r\n<p>Now in her mid-50\'s, Kidjo has just written her life story, <em>Spirit Rising</em>, and released a new album,<em> Eve</em>.
